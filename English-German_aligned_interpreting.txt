     <s id="1:5">it is being discussed in places like this</s>    <s id="1:5">das wird hier in solchen Gremien behandelt</s>

     <s id="1:7">NONE</s>    <s id="1:7">aber wenn ich dann mit Leuten spreche die ihren Arbeitsplatz verloren haben die sagen also naja euh euh das sollten wir jetzt eigentlich doch lieber nicht machen</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">so I think there's no connection between Doha and economic development despite all of the theory that is advanced here </s>    <s id="1:8">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">in relation to globalisation of financial markets I could suggest that that has actually failed us</s>    <s id="1:9">und euh im Zusammenhang mit der Globalisierung der Finanzmärkte würd ich sagen das hat wirklich nichts gebracht</s>
#
     <s id="1:10"> that they is an example of our globalisation has failed us although perhaps it is fairer to say that is the regulation or the lack thereof of financial markets that has failed us</s>    <s id="1:10">das ist ein Beispiel einer gescheiterten Globalisierung auch wenn man fairerweise sagen muss es lag an den fehlenden richtigen Regeln</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and I'm interested in Commissioner McCreevy's recent comments about it is member states regulators building empires that have caused some of the problems in this area but that's perhaps for another debate</s>    <s id="1:11">und euh Kommissar McCreevy hat längst was Vernünftiges gesagt nämlich dass die Regulatoren in Mitlgliedsstaaten Empiren gebaut haben die dafür gesorgt haben dass wir jetzt den Schlamassel haben aber das ist vielleicht ne andere Debatte</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">but it is an example of where we talk of globalisation as being a great thing yet in the financial sector it has not euh been thus</s>    <s id="1:12">aber das zeigt einmal mehr dass jetzt viel über die Globalisierung geredet wurde aber im Finanzsektor hat das jetzt uns nicht geholfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">in relation to agriculture that the other speakers just prior to me have addressed I gathered that agriculture was not the sticking point at Doha but it is a very serious issue and this is one that I have huge concerns about</s>    <s id="1:13">jetzt zur Landwirtschaft ist es so das haben andere also Vorredner erwähnt da gehe ich davon aus dass einfach der Anstoßpunkt euh nicht die Landwirtschaft war obwohl das ein ernsthaftes Problem ist und ich da große Sorge habe</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">maybe it's because I'm older than the last speaker who's in my political group</s>    <s id="1:14">ich bin vielleicht älter als der Vorredner in meiner Fraktion</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">I regard agriculture as rather important because it produces food and therefore euh higher up the scale than he placed it</s>    <s id="1:15">für mich ist die Landwirtschaft ein wichtiges Thema weil da eben Nahrungsmittel produziert werden und ich sehe das als euh etwas bedeutsamer an als er</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">hum and I think we should remember that we voted in this house on a report that I produced about global food security and we are concerned about it and we should be and it should be an issue that is discussed at the Doha level</s>    <s id="1:16">wir sollten das nicht vergessen bei meinem Bericht also über die globale Ernährungssicherheit geht es um ganz konkrete entscheidende Fragen die auch auf Doha-Ebene behandelt werden müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">hum the issue of how European producers farmers can be competitive when in the European Union we have different standards and higher ones of animal welfare in relation to environment that are not addressed at the WTO</s>    <s id="1:17">nämlich wie die europäischen Landwirte aufm Wettbewerb bleiben oder sind in der Union wenn wir unterschiedliche Normen haben also beim Tierschutz bei der Umwelt die also Punkte die auf Doha keine Erwähnung finden</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and you will only bring our citizens with you on this journey if those issues are addressed at the WTO</s>    <s id="1:18">und unsere Bürger machen da nur mit wenn diese Fragen auch eben auf WTO-Ebene debattiert werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and I thnik quite frankly there was never an occasion when we need more direct talk about these things in this chamber and in Geneva than there is now</s>    <s id="1:19">und es ist wirklich jetzt mal an der Zeit ganz konkret hier und in Genf über diese Dinge zu sprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">so I would ask you perhaps in your euh concluding comments if you could address some of those very real issues euh so that people realise that they are being discussed hum because I do not see the Doha round developing in the speed that you are suggesting</s>    <s id="1:20">ich fordere Sie auf ein paar dieser sehr ganz konkreten Probleme anzusprechen damit die Leute auch verstehen draußen dass sie behandelt werden denn für mich ist die Doha-Runde nicht euh etwas was ich in der Richtung entwickelt die mir vorschwebt</s>

     <s id="1:21">perhaps I'm wrong </s>    <s id="1:21">vielleicht täusch ich mich</s>

     <s id="1:7">and I think it's now starting to do euh because it is of such importance particularly in the economic times that we're in at the moment</s>    <s id="1:7">denn dieser Vorschlag ist sehr sehr wichtig vor allen Dingen angesichts der wirtschaftlichen Krise wie wir sie im Moment erleben</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">so what am I talking about </s>    <s id="1:8">wovon spreche ich hier</s>
#
     <s id="1:9"> well the core of the issue president hum is that public authorities in the European Union euh spend huge amounts of public money on buying products and services </s>    <s id="1:9">nun im Wesentlich geht es bei diesem euh Thema um Folgendes die öffentlichen Stellen in der Europäischen Union geben enorme öffentliche Gelder hm aus für Produkte und Dienstleistungen</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">it's estimated that one thousand eight hundred billion euros is spent on public procurement every year</s>    <s id="1:10">man geht davon aus dass etwa eintausendachthundert Milliarden Euro für das öffentliche Beschaffungswesen pro Jahr aufgewendet wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">how much of that procurement is actually spent on investigating researching and encouraging the development of new solutions to the big challenges that public authorities and indeed society is facing every day</s>    <s id="1:11">wie viel euh davon wird wirklich ausgegeben für die Erforschung für euh die euh Suche und für die Förderung der Entwicklung von neuen Möglichkeiten um auf der großen Herausforderungen euh der euh öffentlichen hum Behörden und der Gesellschaft reagieren zu können</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">a better health service a better transport solution dealing with climate change more energy efficient buildings </s>    <s id="1:12">es geht beispielsweise um die Suche nach Lösungen für die Bewältigung des Klimawandels</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">EU procurement spending linked to research and development is less than one per cent of that total procurement budget </s>    <s id="1:13">und die euh Ausgaben im öffentlichen Beschaffungsbereich für Forschung hm macht weniger als ein Prozent des gesamten öffentlichen Beschaffungswesens aus</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and bearing in mind that we have an explicit objective in the Lisbon strategy to move our R&amp;D spending up towards three percent as a target </s>    <s id="1:14">wir haben ja mit der Lissabonner Strategie uns gewisse Ziele gesetzt und haben gesagt wir wollen drei Prozent für Forschung aufwenden</s>
#
     <s id="1:15"> there's huge potential here </s>    <s id="1:15">und daran erkennt man schon dass hier viel Potenzial noch nicht ausgeschöpft ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:16"> and that's where the whole mission of pre-commercial procurement comes in</s>    <s id="1:16">und das ist genau euh da wo diese vorkommerzielle Auftragsvergabe hineinkommt</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">essentially what we're looking for is the intelligent euh the research-focused public authorities to generate a demand for innovative solutions and then work with innovative companies large and small but actually particularly small enterprises who really can benefit from this to fulfil those requirements</s>    <s id="1:17">es geht darum euh eine euh öffentliche Hand zu schaffen die sich an der Forschung ausrichtet die versucht Lösungen zu erforschen und dann mit kleinen oder großen Unternehmen zusammenzuarbeiten um diese euh Projekte weiterzuentwickeln</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and we want those intelligent customers to really think ahead to be demanding to think about the solutions for which no commercial solution yet exists but where there are basically a range of solutions which can then be developed with the financial contribution from the public authority to do that to fund that research and development perhaps through a first competing stage of ideas and then take those solutions to development to a next stage towards the viability of a product or service that can then be launched </s>    <s id="1:18">und wir möchten auch intelligente Kunden die wirklich zukunftsgerichtet denken an Lösungen arbeiten die euh jetzt im Moment noch nicht im kommerziellen Stadium vorhanden sind die aber dann entwickelt werden können mit Hilfe der finanziellen Unterstützung durch die öffentlichen euh Stellen und vielleicht euh könnte man soweit gehen bis euh zum ersten zum Abschluss der ersten Entwicklungsphase um zu prüfen ob ein Produkt oder eine Dienstleistung wirklich auch tragfähig ist und im größeren Rahmen hergestellt werden können</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and the benefits of having that backing on a small enterprise in particular and giving that commercial support will be really important to that business</s>    <s id="1:19">und hier gerade können auch die kleinen Unternehmen eine wichtige Rolle spielen und da wird diese kommerzielle Unterstützung eine wichtige Rolle spielen</s>

     <s id="1:20">and indeed where this has been euh already rolled out we see the experience where businesses even if they don't produce the winning solution have had an element of their research and development funded that they can then go on and use to develop other revenue-generating products</s>    <s id="1:20">und dort euh wo das bereits schon erfolgt ist stellen wir fest dass das Erfolg hat also selbst die Unternehmen die nicht selber die Lösungen gefunden haben haben aber die Möglichkeit gehabt auf die Finanzierung zurückzugreifen und euh andere Produkte zu entwickeln die auch Gewinne gebracht haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">and this also ties in with the second initiative from the Commission which is covered in my report called the lead market initiative where we're looking for public authorities to lead in a number of key technology areas around health and climate change in transport</s>    <s id="1:21">es schließt auch an an eine zweite Initiative der Kommission nämlich die Initiative Lead Market das heißt die öffentlichen Behörden sollen eine führende Rolle in Schlüsseltechnologiebreichen einnehmen um eben Klimawandel bekämpfen zu können im Verkehr Erneuerungen durchführen zu können</s>
#
     <s id="1:22"> and so there is a sign of an integrated policy emerging</s>    <s id="1:22">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">but what my report is asking for is that we need more training we need more best practice we need more dispersion and dissemination of this proposal </s>    <s id="1:23">und in meinem Bericht fordere ich jetzt folgendes  wir brauchen mehr euh Austausch über gute Praxis wir brauchen eine mehr größere Verbreitung dieses Vorschlages</s>
#
     <s id="1:24"> and I hope that the Commissioner and indeed the college will pick this up and that this Parliament will show that it's right behind this solution</s>    <s id="1:24">und ich hoffe dass die Kommissarin und die Kollegen das auch aufgreifen werden dass dieses Parlament  euh auch zeigen wird dass es hinter dieser Lösung steht</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">now in conclusion president if I may euh in my closing minutes and perhaps you'll allow me a short amount of extra time because this is in a sense a point of order for you</s>    <s id="1:25">und als Schlussfolgerung Herr Präsident möchte ich in der letzten Minute noch folgendes sagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">euh first of all I want to point out euh to this empty house euh that there were two opinions that I had for my report </s>    <s id="1:26">zunächst einmal möchte ich unterstreichen hm vor diesem leeren Saal dass es zwei euh Meinungen gegeben hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:27"> from mister Sakalas from the Legal Affairs Committee and misses Podimata in the Industry Committee who are of course are not allowed to present those opinions here which seems rather a shame since they had valuable contributions which I've added to my amendments</s>    <s id="1:27">einmal Herr Sakalas aus dem euh Rechtsausschuss und eine Kollegin aus dem Industrieausschuss die leider sich heute nicht dazu äußern können sie hätten wirklich euh wertvolle Beiträge zu euh leisten</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">and I also want to thank my shadow mister Hasse Ferreira for doing that euh for working with me and he's also contributed extensively</s>    <s id="1:28">und ich möchte auch Herrn Hasse Ferreira meinem Schattenberichterstatter herzlich dafür danken dass er seine Beiträge mir gegenüber euh hm vorgelegt hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">so just to wind up if I may</s>    <s id="1:29">und ich möchte zum Abschluss nur noch folgendes sagen </s>
#
     <s id="1:30">this is a solution where everyone will be winners society citizens public authorities business innovators and the European economy </s>    <s id="1:30">dies ist eine Lösung wo jeder nur davon profitieren kann die Gesellschaft die Bürger die öffentlichen Behörden hm die Unternehmen und die Erfinder und auch die europäische Wirtschaft</s>
#
     <s id="1:31"> and that president it's why it's so important and why when we are looking to public authorities to continue investment in this time of economic crisis this proposal is even more important than it was when I started this report a few months ago </s>    <s id="1:31">und das Herr Präsident macht deutlich warum diese Initiative so wichtig ist und wir wollen dass die öffentlichen Behörden weiter investieren in diesen Zeiten der Wirtschaftskrise und das zeigt dass euh hm euh dieser Bericht noch viel wichtiger ist jetzt als er vielleicht vor ein paar Monaten noch gewesen ist als ich mit diesem Bericht begann</s>

#
     <s id="1:3">and I'd echo hum what's been said by our colleague misses Bauer as well  in terms of our own member states taking action to sign and ratify particular of the conventions and protocols which are missing at the moment</s>    <s id="1:3">und betone das was die Kollegin Bauer bereits ausgeführt hat unsere Mitgliedsländer sind auch aufgerufen ganz besonders euh die Übereinkommen und die Protokolle zu unterzeichenen und zu ratifizieren zumindest diejenigen die das bisher noch nicht gemacht haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">because if we're looking for a common framework and a common approach these are very key reference points which also help to send a signal from member states that they too are concerned about these issues </s>    <s id="1:4">denn wenn wir einen gemeinsamen Rahmen einen gemeinsamen Ansatz haben dann ist es doch ein guter Ausgangspunkt auch für die Mitgliedsländer damit auch sie ihren Teil der Verantwortung für die Systeme übernehmen</s>

     <s id="1:5">so I think that that's one of the key things they should be doing</s>    <s id="1:5">das ist eine der Schlüsselaufgaben die wir übernehmen sollten</s>

#
     <s id="1:7">we welcome much of the report in terms of the rights-based approach which I'd like to see leading on really euh and away from hm almost euh hum this view that it's only about criminal justice </s>    <s id="1:7">wir begrüßen den Bericht weitestgehend das ist ein guter Ansatz ein Ansatz der auf der rechtlichen Seite beruht hier geht es aber nicht nur um Strafrecht</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">but it is actually about the rights of children and young people their protection </s>    <s id="1:8">sondern es geht auch um die Rechte der Kinder und die Rechte von Minderjährigen um den Schutz ihrer Rechte</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and we need those clear measures to support children who have been victims </s>    <s id="1:9">und wir brauchen ganz klare Maßnahmen um die Kinder zu unterstützen die schon Opfer von Missbrauch geworden sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">whether that's in court proceedings where obviously the key issue is we want to find the truth but not in a way that leaves children more traumatised than they were at the beginning of the process and also the collective work on identifying children </s>    <s id="1:10">das Hauptthema ist naütlich das der Wahrheitsfindung aber wir möchten damit die Dramatisierung der Kinder nicht noch verstärken die ist ohnehin schon groß genug und es geht natürlich auch um Zusammenarbeit bei der Identifizierung von Kindern</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">but the protection I think also has to involve the children themselves </s>    <s id="1:11">der Schutz der Kinder muss die Kinder selber miteinbeziehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">that internet literacy is something that we really should be encouraging amongst children and their own understanding about what the dangers are and what it is they should be looking for so that they too can play an active part in helping to combat these crimes</s>    <s id="1:12">das heißt wir müssen unsere Kinder fit machen für das Internet das müssen wir ermutigen wir müssen ihnen klar machen wo die Gefahren liegen wir müssen sie darauf hinweisen worauf sie achten sollten damit sie auch eine aktive Rolle übernehmen können und ihren Teil zur Bekämpfung dieser Verbrechen leisten</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">we do hum have the intention of supporting certain of the amendments euh this morning particularly where we think there're certain principles which hm we tamper with euh at our peril whether that's on double criminality and confidentiality in certain professions</s>    <s id="1:13">wir wollen einige der Änderungsanträge unterstützen ganz besonders da wo wir denken dass euh es um wichtige Themen geht doppelte euh Kriminalität zum Beispiel herausstreichen von bestimmten Berufszweigen</s>

#
     <s id="1:2">hum there is such political agreement on this issue that it seems strange that so little is happening  in member states </s>    <s id="1:2">es gab hier so eine große politische Einhelligkeit dass eigentlich seltsam ist dass so wenig geschieht in den Mitgliedsstaaten</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">and could I just say that our focus on the internet is obviously very important</s>    <s id="1:3">ich möchte sagen ich möchte mich euh da euh es ist euh wichtig dass wir uns auf's Internet konzentrieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">but it would suggest that this problem is a new one when we clearly know that it is a very old problem and was very hidden </s>    <s id="1:4">aber man kann doch nicht sagen das ist n neues Problem das ist ein uraltes Problem das sich aber immer verborgen hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">hum and it happened not just outside schools with bags of sweets but it happened in homes in all of our member states in churches and in hospitals</s>    <s id="1:5">und das geschah nicht nur mit Bonbontüten vor den Schulen sondern in unseren Zuhausen in den Mitgliedsstaaten in Krankenhäusern in Kirchen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and therefore perhaps the internet has shone a mirror on this very dark part of society which we are still grappling with and grappling very badly with </s>    <s id="1:6">und das euh Internet ist vielleicht nur ein Spiegel wo sich dieser dunkle Teil der Gesellschaft spiegelt und wir versuchen immer noch und sehr mühselig das in den Griff zu bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">hum so it is very urgent that member states take seriously their many fine words about protecting children just as we in this house have spoken very much about how we value and protect children</s>    <s id="1:7">und die Mitgliedsstaaten müssen die wunderschönen Sonntagsreden mal ernst nehmen zum Kinderschutz  genau wie wir im Parlament euh auch viel davon gesprochen haben wie hoch wir Kinder schätzen wie wir sie schützen wollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">but in fact our actions often are much weaker than the strong words we speak </s>    <s id="1:8">aber unsere Taten sind dann oft sehr viel schwächer als die starken Worte die wir finden</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">hum I mentioned that the home is the place which is most sometimes the most dangerous one for children</s>    <s id="1:9">das Zuhause ist manchmal der gefährlichste Ort für Kinder</s>
#
     <s id="1:10"> we've had a recent case in Ireland about this </s>    <s id="1:10">wir hatten einen jüngsten Fall in Irland</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">I would also add that those who believe that small towns where everyone knows one another is a safe place for children need to think again </s>    <s id="1:11">und lassen Sie mich hinzufügen die die glauben dass Kleinstädte wo jeder den anderen kennt ein sicherer Ort für Kinder wäre also der sollte nochmal nachdenken</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">in small towns people very often close their eyes because they do not want to speak about soft information that they have and are perhaps afraid to pass on to the authorities</s>    <s id="1:12">denn oft werden gerade dort die Augen verschlossen da will man nicht reden von Informationen die man durchaus hat und oft ist man dort auch hat man Angst sich an die Behörden zu wenden</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">this is something that we all need to look at and be prepared to speak about because silence causes abuse to literally grow and causes awful damage for the children who are caught in that situation </s>    <s id="1:13">all das müssen wir uns anschauen  und wir müssen auch bereit sein das beim Namen zu nennen denn Schweigen für zu Missbrauch euh und die Kinder wachsen so auf und sind geschädigt wenn sie so etwas mitmachen müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">I would call on the Irish government to bring forward legislation on a wide range of protection to children against sexual abuse </s>    <s id="1:14">wir fordern die irische Regierung auf Gesetze zu erlassen zu einem weitem Bereich des Schutzes von Kindern gegen sexuellen Missbrauch</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and I also think we also need to look at our constitution which puts the family before the rights of the child </s>    <s id="1:15">und ich glaube wir müssen uns auch unsere Verfassung nochmal anschauen denn da steht die Familie über dem Kinderrecht</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">they should not be in conflict both deserve protection from our constitution</s>    <s id="1:16">das darf nicht gegeneinander verwendet werden beides verdient den Schutz durch die Verfassung</s>

     <s id="1:16">and if I look around my own constituency Yorkshire hum we already see considerable investments in renewable technologies in energy-efficiency measures in different companies and now we have plans to develop carbon capture storage in many of our power plants and major industries this will create jobs and it will also hum help us cut our emissions which of course is the object of our whole hum all the work we've been doing</s>    <s id="1:16">und überall wo ich mich umschaue sehe ich dass Maßnahmen in Energieeffizienz euh Maßnahmen in Unternehmen und so weiter oder auch die Pläne für die Abschaltung und Speicherung des euh Kohlenstoffs in vielen euh hum Kraftwerken und so weiter nicht nur Arbeitsplätze schaffen werden sondern eben auch dazu beitragen werden unsere Emissionen zu senken was ja das Ziel unserer Arbeit war</s>

#
     <s id="1:1">hello hum Commissioner</s>    <s id="1:1">Frau Kommissarin </s>
#
     <s id="1:2">in your opening speech you mentioned several disasters</s>    <s id="1:2">in Ihrer Einleitung haben Sie mehrere Katastrophen erwähnt</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">and among them you've mentioned the heatwave in France several years ago</s>    <s id="1:3">unter anderem hm die Hitzewelle in Frankreich vor mehreren Jahren</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">they claimed the live of euh between twelve and fourteen thousand people</s>    <s id="1:4">nun euh es waren zwischen zwölf und vierzehntausend Menschen die dabei umgekommen sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">but I think just to set the record straight on this this was not a storm a flash flood</s>    <s id="1:5">aber damit euh folgendes klargestellt wird  es war kein euh Sturm es war keine plötzliche Überschwemmung</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">this was nothing like those natural disasters </s>    <s id="1:6">es war also nichts euh wie diese Naturkatastrophen</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">this heatwave lasted five to six weeks </s>    <s id="1:7">diese Hitzewelle hat fünf bis sechs Wochen gedauert</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">those deaths came in over five or six weeks </s>    <s id="1:8">und diese Todesfälle erstrecken sich über fünf oder sechs Wochen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">almost all of the people who died were either disabled or elderly and in nursing home or residential care or in respite while their families were on holidays</s>    <s id="1:9">fast alle Menschen die dabei gestorben sind waren entweder schwache und euh ältere Menschen waren in Pflegeheimen oder ihre Familien waren euh in Urlaub oder weg</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">the French government at no time recalled the families recalled staff from their holidays nor did they even call in the army or any other rescue services </s>    <s id="1:10">die euh französische Regierung hatte nie das Personal aus dem Urlaub zurückgerufen nicht einmal der Armee oder andere Rettungsdienste eingesetzt</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">they just allowed people week after week to die </s>    <s id="1:11">es euh sind die Menschen Wochen nach Woche dabei euh gestorben</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">now I have spoken to many people in France about this incident because I'm involved in the Commission-funded project on rescuing people with disabilities in disasters </s>    <s id="1:12">ich habe mit vielen in Frankreich euh über dieses Ereignis gesprochen denn euh ich habe zu tun mit euh Rettung von euh Menschen die behindert sind euh oder</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and this was a scandal</s>    <s id="1:13">es war ein Skandal</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">it's a scandal that no one has put their finger on or identified</s>    <s id="1:14">ein Skandal auf den keiner mit dem Finger hingewiesen hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and I would ask the Commission to investigate that heatwave investigate the level of deaths</s>    <s id="1:15">und die Kommission sollte diese Hitzewelle näher ermitteln wie viele Todesfälle es gab</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and realise that France did nothing about that</s>    <s id="1:16">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and yet that autumn when September came and all those people were buried there were fourteen thousand fewer people on their social services  </s>    <s id="1:17">und Frankreich wusste es und hat trotzdem euh in diesem Herbst euh als es dann September war und all diese Menschen begraben wurden vierzehntausend euh Menschen euh waren die praktisch auf ihrem Gewissen waren</s>

#
     <s id="1:1">thank you madam President</s>    <s id="1:1">danke euh Frau Präsidentin</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">and I'd like to thank the Commission for that very detailed euh statement on this subject </s>    <s id="1:2">ich möchte mich bei der Kommission bedanken für diese detaillierte Erklärung zu diesem Thema </s>
#
     <s id="1:3">hum I think the reason we're debating this tonight is because we want to learn lessons and ensure that it doesn't happen again</s>    <s id="1:3">der Grund weswegen wir heute darüber diskutieren ist weil wir Lehren daraus euh ziehen wollen um sicherzustellen dass dies nicht wieder vorkommt</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">the difficulty is that back in nineteen ninety nine when we discovered a problem in Belgium we thought then that we had tightened up our rules sufficiently euh so that there would not be another incident</s>    <s id="1:4">im Jahre neunzehnhundertneunundneunzig das ist die Schwierigkeit als wir in Belgien ein Problem euh entdeckten dachten wir dass unsere Regeln jetzt euh straff und streng genug seien damit nicht derartiges sich wiederholen kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">however we are where we are now</s>    <s id="1:5">aber jetzt stehen wir eben da wo wir stehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and we know the consequences of the system's failure not just in terms of money although that is hugely significant hum for the European Union for the Irish Exchequer for taxpayers and also the lack of and loss of confidence among consumers and the damage generally to the Irish hum food producing sector euh in terms of markets</s>    <s id="1:6">und wir kennen die Konsequenzen des Scheiterns des Systems nicht nur finanziell betrachtet obwohl es um riesige Geldbeträge für die Union geht  für  die euh irische Kasse und natürlich auch für den Steuerzahler aber auch dass das Vertrauen der Verbraucher damit euh beeinträchtigt wird und natürlich der Schaden für die euh Lebensmittelhersteller in Irland sie büßen ihre Märkte ein</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">euh I'm happy that we have made progress now and are restoring our name on the international marketplace </s>    <s id="1:7">und das freut mich dass wir jetzt Fortschritte erzielen dass so unser Ruf auf den internationalen euh Märkten wiederhergestellt wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">but I'm also acutely aware that farmers throughout the European Union also euh face problems because of the Irish difficulty</s>    <s id="1:8">aber hm ich stelle fest dass auch andere in der Union wegen dieser irischen Schwierigkeiten mit Problemen konfrontiert sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and that's why I think that tonight's debate is not about Ireland</s>    <s id="1:9">also heute geht es nicht nur in der Aussprache um Irland</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">because this problem that occurred in Ireland in my view from your statement clearly has the potential to happen in other member states</s>    <s id="1:10">denn das Problem das in Irland aufgrund ihrer Erklärung aufgetreten ist auf jeden Fall auch woanders vorkommen könnte</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">hum so that is I suppose where the starting point for this debate must be</s>    <s id="1:11">und ich vermute dass dies wohl der Ausgangspunkt für diese Aussprache sein muss</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">we know that this oil should not have got into the animal feed chain</s>    <s id="1:12">wir euh wissen dass dieses Öl gar nicht in die Futtermittelkette hätte gelangen dürfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">what we're trying to find out is how did that happen and as you rightly say that is the subject of legal investigation police investigation with a cross-border dimension to it</s>    <s id="1:13">aber wir müssen jetzt herausfinden wie dies geschehen konnte und wie sie zu Recht sagen da müssen erst einmal rechtliche polizeiliche Ermittlungen mit einer grenzüberschreitenden Dimension durchgeführt werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and we will I hope find out the exact if you like trail of events euh so that again we can hum avoid a similar occurrence</s>    <s id="1:14">und dann werden wir feststellen wie überhaupt dies geschehen ist die ganze Ereigniskette damit derartiges nicht sich wiederholen kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">but it also raises another question and that is how we handle waste or surplus food</s>    <s id="1:15">aber es stellt sich noch eine weitere Frage in diesem Zusammenhang  nämlich wie wir mit euh Rückständen Überschussnahrungsmitteln umgehen sollten</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and you have alluded to that hum recycling is now the thing to do</s>    <s id="1:16">sie haben das ja auch angedeutet</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">everybody's in favour of it and because we all want to be environmentally friendly and sustainable</s>    <s id="1:17">nun alle sind zwar dafür wir wollen ja alle umweltfreundlich und nachhaltig sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">NONE</s>    <s id="1:18">aber was sollte man jetzt tun</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">hum so there are two issues here</s>    <s id="1:19">es gibt hier zwei Fragen</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">first of all the issue of recycling of oils and I think that needs a more careful attention as you have alluded to not just in relation to PCBs but generally euh the collection the distribution the handling etc of waste oils</s>    <s id="1:20">erst einmal Altöle und das Recycling des Altöls und dem muss man mehr Aufmerksamkeit schenken wie sie gesagt haben nicht nur im Zusammenhang mit PCB sondern die Einsammlung die Verteilung wie man mit Altöl umgeht</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">there is a particular worry obviously about PCBs but surplus food or waste food as it is sometimes called in my own view is that it is appropriate that we use this product in the animal feed chain</s>    <s id="1:21">das ist etwas was uns besorgt und natürlich offensichtlich PCB aber hm euh hm Nahrungsmittelrückstände hm ja da meine ich dass es euh doch angemessen ist in der Futtermittelkette diese Produkte zu verwenden zur Tierfütterung</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">but I want to say very clearly that if we cannot guarantee its safety how it's processed and handled then I'm afraid we may need to look at banning this in the food and feed chain</s>    <s id="1:22">aber wir können nicht die Sicherheit garantieren wie es verarbeitet wurde  wie man damit umgegangen ist  deswegen müssten wir vielleicht doch in der Nahrungs und euh Futtermittelkette dies verbieten</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">and I would not like to see that happen</s>    <s id="1:23">ich möchte das zwar nicht</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">but then again I would not like to see happen again what occurred in Ireland and the subsequent consequences of it</s>    <s id="1:24">aber andererseits möchte ich nicht dass sich das was in Irland geschehen ist wiederholt und die Konsequenzen dieses euh Zwischenfalls</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">because what we want is that hum this surplus or waste food to be used because it's good quality not because it's the animal feed chain is a dumping ground for it</s>    <s id="1:25">wir möchten natürlich dass diese Rückstände verwendet werden aber weil sie von hoher Güte sind nicht weil sie einfach so entsorgt werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">and I think there is an important point in that</s>    <s id="1:26">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">we need to talk too very openly about the whole mixing of animal feeds </s>    <s id="1:27">und wir müssen vor allem sehen wie Futtermittel gemischt werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">farmers like to buy ingredients and like to mix their own rations and generally larger farmers do that</s>    <s id="1:28">die euh Landwirte kaufen gerne Zutaten und machen selbst daraus ihre Mischung das mögen die Landwirte im Normalfall</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">and that's appropriate if we have tight controls on it</s>    <s id="1:29">aber es müsste natürlich streng kontrolliert werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">I understand that there are regular checks carried out but clearly in this case there were some gaps in that market and indeed those farmers who were caught in a sense hum because they used this product and suffered consequences were saying to me why wasn't somebody coming and checking what was coming into our yards </s>    <s id="1:30">es sind auch regelmäßige Kontrollen durchgeführt worden aber da gab es offensichtlich auf diesen Märkten Lücken und euh die Landwirte die diese Produkte verwendet haben und euh die Konsequenzen erlitten haben diese haben mir gesagt warum ist niemand zu uns gekommen und hat das was bei uns geschehen ist kontrolliert</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">on the issue of regulation I believe that there are very tight controls on licensed animal feed operators the compound feed industry of the European Union</s>    <s id="1:31">jetzt zu den euh Regelungen es gibt zum Beispiel sehr strenge Kontrollen zum Beispiel bei Mischfutter bei den verschiedenen Bestandteilen des Futtermittel</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">and they came in because of practices in the past which we needed to tighten up on </s>    <s id="1:32">und das euh ist geschehen weil wir festgestellt haben in der Vergangenheit dass dies strenger geregelt werden musste</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">I have a sense that in member states hum we regulate the compliant particularly tightly </s>    <s id="1:33">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:34">NONE</s>    <s id="1:34">aber vor allem müssen wir dafür sorgen dass diese Vorschriften eingehalten werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:35">and we don't  keep a look at the potentially non-compliant</s>    <s id="1:35">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:36">NONE</s>    <s id="1:36">wir sollten nicht euh potenziell immer sehen wo vielleicht etwas nicht eingehalten werden könnte</s>
#
     <s id="1:37">we don't think outside the box that there is perhaps a tendency once the paper trail is correct and the boxes if you like are ticked to put it all to bed and not look underneath the surface </s>    <s id="1:37">also wir sollten nicht irgendwie nach außen gucken euh wir sollten erst einmal sicherstellen dass wenn alles auch vorliegt die Regeln vorhanden sind dass diese auch eingehalten werden und dass wir nicht immer woanders blicken sollten</s>
#
     <s id="1:38">and I do think we need to look again at regulation </s>    <s id="1:38">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:39">we're looking at it again in the financial sector and we need to look at it too in the food sector </s>    <s id="1:39">also gut die Verordnung der Finanzsektor aber wir müssen auch im euh Lebensmittelsektor dies prüfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:40">and I would also think that at farm level inspectors are sometimes regarded as the devil incarnate coming on to farms </s>    <s id="1:40">und euh in den euh landwirtschaftlichen Betrieben betrachtet man oft euh die Inspektoren als der Teufel praktisch der auf sie zukommt</s>
#
     <s id="1:41">why isn't it that farmers would welcome inspectors in because they would see them as protectors of their businesses</s>    <s id="1:41">sie sollten eher den Inspektor als jemand der ihr Geschäft schützt verstehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:42">and I think we need to change the mindset now in the entire food chain based on this experience</s>    <s id="1:42">wir sollten unsere Einstellung in der gesamten Lebensmittelkette nach diesem Zwischenfall ändern</s>
#
     <s id="1:43">I welcome very particularly the announcement of the Irish Farmers' Association that they are setting up a food taskforce </s>    <s id="1:43">und ich finde auch dass die irischen euh landwirtschaftlichen Betriebe jetzt euh eine Lebensmittel-Task-Force errichtet haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:44">it is high time that farmers took some control of the food chain that they are perhaps the first step on</s>    <s id="1:44">es ist an der Zeit dass sie auch strenger ihre Nahrungsmittelkette kontrollieren können</s>
#
     <s id="1:45">and lastly the issue of low-cost ingredients is not one for now but the pressure on producers to produce ever more cheaply is part of this issue and needs to be addressed</s>    <s id="1:45">dann euh diese billigen Zutaten nämlich die Produzenten die immer mehr unter Druck geraten immer billiger zu produzieren das sollte man auch euh prüfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:46">thank you</s>    <s id="1:46">NONE</s>

     <s id="1:1">hum my colleague mentioned the murky channels by which PCBs came into euh the food chain in Ireland </s>    <s id="1:1">meine Kollegin hat eben von diesen merkwürdigen Kanälen gesprochen durch die PCB in die Nahrungsmittelkette und Futtermittelkette in Irland gegangen ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">and I think maybe it's worse sometimes looking back at the history of PCBs </s>    <s id="1:2">und da ist manchmal ganz gut sich die Geschichte der PCBs anzusehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">polychlorinated biphenyls are almost a hundred years old</s>    <s id="1:3">die sind fast hundert Jahre alt </s>
#
     <s id="1:4">they are man-made</s>    <s id="1:4">die sind von Menschen hergestellt worden</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and from the very beginning it was obvious they were very very dangerous</s>    <s id="1:5">und von Anfang an war klar dass das ein ganz gefährlicher Stoff ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">they were used for many years in capacitors hydraulic fuels wood floor finishes clearly not something we want in the food chain </s>    <s id="1:6">die PCBs sind in euh in euh Holzlack und in anderen euh Bereichen euh in der Industrie verwendet worden aber es war schon klar dass das nicht für die Lebensmittelindustrie ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">but it almost from the early nineteen hundreds until nineteen sixty six before a Swedish scientist actually established their danger people looked the other way and allowed them to be used even though numerous industrial accidents happened over and over and over again </s>    <s id="1:7">und euh aber schon sehr früh bevor ein schwedischer Wissenschaftler die Gefahr wirklich festgestellt und nachgewiesen hat hat man gerne davor die Augen euh verschlossen  und es gab eine ganze Reihe von Arbeitsunfälle in euh der verarbeitenden Industrie</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">but even once the science was in place it was really into the nineteen seventies nineteen seventy two before PCBs in public areas was banned but still allowed to be used </s>    <s id="1:8">aber auch als man euh mehr Erkenntnisse hatte hat es bis in die siebziger Jahre genau neunzehnhundertzweiundsiebzig gedauert bis euh der euh offizielle euh der Verbrauch von PCBs euh offiziell euh verboten wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and it was not fully stopped til the year two thousand </s>    <s id="1:9">und wirklich eingestellt hat man die Verwendung erst euh nach zweitausend</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">so you know there's a lot of PCBs out there and they were left out there almost a hundred years after we knew there was a problem </s>    <s id="1:10">also es gibt PCB und dieses PCB ist euh seit praktisch hundert Jahren seitdem wir eben wissen dass es da eben Gefahren gibt euh vorhanden</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">NONE</s>    <s id="1:11">und wir müssen uns damit auseinandersetzen</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">so despite the Commission's directive euh of ninety six which required the disposal of PCBs we find them coming up again and again and in particular in Belgium and in Ireland recently </s>    <s id="1:12">und wir haben neunzehnhundertsechsundneunzig eben die Richtlinie und darin ist vorgeschrieben euh dass PCBs entsorgt werden müssen aber immer wieder tauchen sie auf in Belgien haben wir das erlebt vor Kurzem in Irland</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but one thing I found that really confused people in Ireland</s>    <s id="1:13">aber eins ist dabei euh euh ganz besonders verstörend für euh die Menschen in Irland</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and I remember visiting a butcher around that time</s>    <s id="1:14">ich kann mich da euh euh nur erinnern an einen euh Metzger in Irland mit dem ich gesprochen habe</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and he just couldn't understand</s>    <s id="1:15">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">he said we've put into place so much traceability</s>    <s id="1:16">der hat gesagt  wir haben so viel getan  wir haben die Rückverfolgbarkeit euh euh eingeführt</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">you know we can know where this egg hum comes exact from what day it was laid</s>    <s id="1:17">wir wissen euh genau an welchem Tag dieses Ei gelegt wurde wo es herkommt</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and if we really want to delve a little bit further we can find out exactly what farm et cetera </s>    <s id="1:18">und wenn wir wollen können wir genau euh feststellen in welcher Ecke welchem Bauernhof dieses Ei gelegt wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and yet even after we knew the source of the PCBs this butcher who sources all his own pork had all the code numbers et cetera et cetera was still being forced to throw away destroy pork</s>    <s id="1:19">aber sogar nachdem wir wussten wo diese euh PCB-Quelle lag hat euh dieser euh Metzger der sein eigenes Fleisch produzierte und alles genau kontrollierte doch auch euh den Zwang erlebt dass er seine Produkte vernichten musste dass er sie nicht verkaufen konnte</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">now I don't understand how that happened</s>    <s id="1:20">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:21"> because we have really we've worked so hard in the Environment Committee</s>    <s id="1:21">wir haben im Umweltausschuss uns so intensiv euh mit diesen Dingen beschäfigt</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">you've worked so hard to make traceability to fine tune traceability </s>    <s id="1:22">Sie alle haben euh doch auch sich einverstanden erklärt damit dass euh diese Dinge zurückverfolgt werden können</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">NONE</s>    <s id="1:23">und euh dann haben wir feststellen müssen dass diese Stoffe euh wiederverwendet worden sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">and yet when the chips were down those systems were not used </s>    <s id="1:24">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">they weren't  used maybe they were used to find the farms but they weren't used to let the innocent off the hook </s>    <s id="1:25">und euh vor allen Dingen ist es so schlimm weil auch die Unschuldigen immer mitleiden müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">and this cost people an awful lot and it cost my country an awful lot that it wasn't these you know these particular supply chains it was the whole country that was blackened </s>    <s id="1:26">und das hat mein euh Land erst einmal in ein großes Chaos gestürzt und zweitens euh eine große euh finanzielle Belastung auferlegt</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">and I get and you know there is confusion about other things </s>    <s id="1:27">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">NONE</s>    <s id="1:28">und dann möchte ich euh noch etwas anderes klarstellen</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">we are talking today about PCBs and dioxins</s>    <s id="1:29">denn wir sprechen hier oft euh von euh PCB und Dioxinen</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">and yet rightly so</s>    <s id="1:30">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">but are we going to spend a hundred years before we realise the connection between dioxins and incineration</s>    <s id="1:31">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">NONE</s>    <s id="1:32">aber wenn euh wir euh uns euh diese euh Dinge näher ansehen dann müssten wir sehen dass wir auch schon geraume Zeit wissen über die Verbindung euh von Verbrennungsfaktoren und Dioxin</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">something that I am also constantly trying to avoid to keep that out of the food chain as well through incineration    </s>    <s id="1:33">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:34">NONE</s>    <s id="1:34">und es ist klar dass das in Nahrungsmitteln überhaupt nichts zu suchen hat</s>

     <s id="1:8">if not was it not the responsibility of the member state to ensure that such defiance of basic regulatory requirements was discovered and dealt with</s>    <s id="1:8">und wenn nicht war es dann nicht die Verantwortung des Mitgliedsstaats sicherzustellen dass solche Grundsatzregeln und die Verstöße gegen diese Grundsatzregeln eigentlich entdeckt wurden</s>

     <s id="1:9">thirdly was millstream implementing an HACCP-based risk analysis and an auto-control plan as required by the food hygiene regulation</s>    <s id="1:9">und dann hum euh gab es eine Risikoanalyse hum euh Kontrollen hum nach der euh Lebensmittelhygieneverordnung</s>

#
     <s id="1:11">was there negligence on the part of the Irish authorities in enforcing with rigour the feed law and food safety requirements </s>    <s id="1:11">gab es Nachlässigkeit von Seiten der irischen Behörden euh als es darum ging die Sicherheitsanforderungen zu erfüllen und durchzusetzen</s>

     <s id="1:4">Commissioner one source euh of euh human exposure to PCBs is through the food chain as you say</s>    <s id="1:4">nun eine Quelle für die menschliche Exposition von PCB ist die Lebensmittelkette</s>

     <s id="1:6">let's be proportional and let's keep the hysteria out of this debate and more light and less heat on it</s>    <s id="1:6">also wir sollten das im richtigen Verhältnis sehen und nicht hysterisch werden</s>

     <s id="1:7">yes minimal euh requirements for feed hygiene euh euh are very important and must be rigorously enforced</s>    <s id="1:7">gut also Mindestanforderungen an euh Futtermittelhygiene das ist sehr wichtig und muss streng durchgesetzt werden</s>

     <s id="1:8">but they must also be accompanied by full identification traceability for all meat products and not just beef but also for poultry pig meat and sheep meat</s>    <s id="1:8">aber gleichzeitig auch eine vollständige Identifizierung und Rückverfolgbarkeit aller Fleischprodukte und nicht nur Rindfleisch aber auch für Geflügelfleisch Schweinefleisch und Schaffleisch</s>

     <s id="1:9">now I've amendments to that effect down to current legislation that we're discussing euh in the house shortly</s>    <s id="1:9">und hum deswegen euh Änderungen der Gesetzgebung über die euh wir bald hier im Parlament diskutieren werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">yes the pig feed concerned was contaminated by breadcrumb hum because hm inadvertently millstream recycling used euh euh euh fuel fuel that to dry the euh breadcrumb that they had bought in good faith from a company they had dealt with for years and had had no previous problems </s>    <s id="1:10">ja euh das Schweinefutter war kontaminiert durch euh Brotkrümel weil Millstream Recycling unbeabsichtigt einen Kraftstoff verwendet hat zum Trocknen der Brotkrümel die sie euh guten Glaubens erworben hatten von einem Unternehmen mit dem sie seit Jahren zu tun hatten mit denen sie bisher nie Probleme hatten</s>

     <s id="1:14">that will be proven not to be so</s>    <s id="1:14">es euh wird sich zeigen dass dem nicht so war</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">so let's be careful what we say here</s>    <s id="1:15">wir müssen aufpassen was wir hier sagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">I think the biggest problem was that we had to have one hundred per cent withdrawal of all pig meat hum products and destroyed euh hm for short term</s>    <s id="1:16">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">NONE</s>    <s id="1:17">nur euh es müsste praktisch das gesamte Schweinefleisch alle Schweinefleischprodukte zu hundert Prozent ausm Verkehr gezogen werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">albeit the livelihoods of many Irish farmers and indeed the reputation of Irish euh euh hm food products abroad because we had to have such a disproportionate response when only six to seven per cent of our pig farms were contaminated because hm the Irish system of identification and traceability failed at the point of the slaughter-house</s>    <s id="1:18">aber das wär katastrophal für viele Landwirte in Irland und für die irischen Nahrungsmittelprodukte im Ausland weil wir eine so unverhältnismäßige Reaktion hatten euh weil ja eigentlich nur sieben Prozent der Schweinebetriebe kontaminiert waren weil das Rückverfolgbarkeitssystem im Schlachthof gescheitert war</s>

     <s id="1:19">all pigs are supposed to be eartagged in Ireland or slap marked</s>    <s id="1:19">irgendwie sollten sie eigentlich markiert werden</s>

     <s id="1:20">but somehow at the slaughter-house level we couldn't identify those pigs that had had the contaminated feed euh from the vast majority of our pigs that hadn't</s>    <s id="1:20">aber in den Schlachthöfen könnten wir die Schweine die das kontaminierte Futter erhalten hatten nicht identifizieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">we need again to look at that</s>    <s id="1:21">und das müssen wir prüfen</s>

     <s id="1:22">the Commission needs to look at the whole role of identification and traceability</s>    <s id="1:22">die Kommission muss die Rolle der Identifizierung der Rückverfolgbarkeit nochmals prüfen</s>

#
     <s id="1:24">the company concerned are extremely sorry and have said so publicly madam president euh hm for the damage caused to the food chain and Ireland's reputation and indeed the economic damage caused to so many farmers euh who purchased their feed excellent feed product up to this point</s>    <s id="1:24">die betroffenen Unternehmen euh es tut ihnen wirklich sehr leid das haben sie auch ganz öffentlich gesagt aufgrund der euh Folgen für die Lebensmittelkette und euh für ihren Ruf  und dann der verheerende Schaden den so viele Landwirte erlitten haben</s>

     <s id="1:12">and I would be first to admit that the feeding of meat and bone meal back to cattle caused the BSE problem and it wasn't the finest hour for anybody</s>    <s id="1:12">und ich muss da gleich zugeben euh dass euh das BSE-Problem durch Tiermehlfutter hervorgerufen wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and so that's why we actually bring this legislation forward</s>    <s id="1:13">und deswegen bringen wir ja auch euh diesen Rechtsakt jetzt hier vor</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and the whole argument now is not about whether we should have transparency and have on the label the ingredients because that's precisely what will be there</s>    <s id="1:14">es geht jetzt nicht um die Frage ob Transparenz auf dem Etikett vorhanden sein muss das wird ja ohnehin gegeben</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">the argument that the manufacturers had was did they have to put the precise percentages so that somebody could then turn round and copy that feed and it make exactly the same feed</s>    <s id="1:15">was die Produzenten sagen ist müssen jetzt genau die Gewichtsprozentsanteile angeben dann könnte jemand das nämlich nachmachen und genau das selbe Futter verkaufen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and so I think that is where the compromise and the work that Graefe zu Baringdorf the Commission and Council have done is so good</s>    <s id="1:16">und da haben wir jetzt eben mit dem Rat der Kommission und euh mit Herrn Graefe zu Baringdorf einen so guten Kompromiss erzielt</s>

#
     <s id="1:18">because if you look recently at the problems that we've had in Europe and we've had problems in various countries with animal feed this is not because the labelling system and the process has been  wrong it's been the fact that companies have actually broken the law </s>    <s id="1:18">wenn wir uns mal anschauen was wir in Europa in der letzten Zeit für Probleme hatten in verschiedenen Ländern mit dem Tierfutter dann lag das nicht daran dass euh das Auszeichnungssystem falsch war  sondern dass euh Unternehmen gegen das Gesetz verstoßen haben</s>

     <s id="1:19">and so therefore it's not only a case </s>    <s id="1:19">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">now we're making sure that we get this law right</s>    <s id="1:20">und jetzt werden wir also dafür sorgen  dass einerseits das Gesetz eingehalten wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">it is also a case to make sure that the Commission and member states actually monitor this law and actually inspect the feed companies to make sure they aren't breaking the rules because again people and consumers have to have confidence in our food  </s>    <s id="1:21">wir werden aber auch dafür sorgen dass die Mitgliedsstaaten das überwachen und dass sie die Futtermittelproduzenten überwachen und sicherstellen dass sie nicht gegen das Gesetz verstoßen denn die Verbraucher müssen Vertrauen in diese Futtermittel haben</s>

     <s id="1:22">and I would say to you that European food is as safe as we can get it</s>    <s id="1:22">europäische Nahrungsmittel sind so sicher wie's überhaupt nur sein kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">but we must never we must never let up to make sure that our consumers are absolutely satisfied that what they are eating is safe                            </s>    <s id="1:23">aber wir müssen dann immer dafür sorgen dass die Verbraucher auch zufrieden sind mit dem dass sie sich sicher sind dass das Essen euh sicher ist</s>

     <s id="1:2">hum I do not hold with the notion that our economic salvation lies in tiny value added tax cuts something we've had in the United Kingdom with frankly marginal positiv impact</s>    <s id="1:2">also unsere wirtschaftliche Rettung liegt jetzt meines Erachtens nicht unbedingt euh in euh kleinen Reduzierungen des Mehrwertsteuersatzes also im Vereinigten Königreich hatten wir so etwas ja und da hatte man also nur ganz geringe positive Auswirkungen</s>

     <s id="1:9">euh here in the house renovations and extensions in energy-saving euh improvements perhaps in gardening and landscaping work as mister Olle Schmidt said care for the elderly and care for children and so forth </s>    <s id="1:9">euh zum Beispiel Renovierung Ausweitung energieeinsparende Renovierung vielleicht auch bei Gartenarbeiten und bei Parkgestaltungen oder Pflege für alte Menschen wie Herr Schmidt gesagt hat euh das sind die euh oder Kinderbetreuung</s>
#
     <s id="1:10"> these areas are the ones which would actually get people into work and probably increase the tax-take because these people would be paying tax on their incomes as well </s>    <s id="1:10">das wird Arbeitsplätze schaffen und euh dann auch die Steuereinnahmen letztendlich erhöhen weil diese Menschen dann auch Einkommensteuer bezahlen</s>

     <s id="1:1">thank you President </s>    <s id="1:1">herzlichen Dank Frau Präsident</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">euh  I also welcome the Commission's proposal and believe it to be an intelligent response to the crisis that we are facing </s>    <s id="1:2">ja ich möchte auch den Kommissionsvorschlag begrüßen ich glaube das ist wirklich eine intelligente Reaktion auf die Krise</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">like others who have spoken and indeed the previous speaker I strongly believe that this proposal must apply to energy conservation </s>    <s id="1:3">die Kollegen haben jetzt schon gesprochen und gerade die Vorrednerin euh hat das auch gesagt also es ist wichtig dass energieeinsparende Maßnahmen unterstützt werden müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">and energy conservation measures must be a high priority of the member states</s>    <s id="1:4">das muss eine ganz klare Priorität der Mitgliedsstaaten sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">reduced costs for home installation would achieve three of our cherished objectives</s>    <s id="1:5">ermäßigte Sätze für Wohnungsbau euh das würde ja unterschiedlichen Zielen dienen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6"> it would reduce environmental damage by reducing CO2 emissions </s>    <s id="1:6">Umweltschäden würden eingegrenzt werden durch geringere CO2-Emissionen</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">it would assist in job creation because energy conservation measures are very labour-intensive </s>    <s id="1:7">Arbeitsplätze würden geschaffen denn energiesparende Maßnahmen sind ja sehr arbeitsintensiv</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and thirdly of course in the long run it would lower energy bills for the elderly and other vulnerable people in society </s>    <s id="1:8">und drittens das ist langfristig zu sehen werden wir geringere Energierechnungen haben für diejenigen die am empfindlichsten sind in der Gesellschaft auch für ältere Menschen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">so I hope the Commission will press ahead with this proposal will persuade the member states that so far remain unpersuaded and will emphasize that as part of the proposal you can interpret energy conservation measures as being included </s>    <s id="1:9">also ich hoffe dass wir das unterstützen werden dass man auch die Mitgliedsstaaten überzeugen wird die noch nicht überzeugt sind und man sollte hum wirklich euh betonen dass energiesparende Maßnahmen hier ganz klar mit eingeschlossen werden sollen</s>

#
     <s id="1:2">hum I'd like to congratulate euh both rapporteurs euh as we come to the first stage of the two thousand ten budget </s>    <s id="1:2">ich möchte beide Berichterstatter beglückwünschen im Zusammenhang mit der ersten Phase des Haushaltsverfahrens zweitausendzehn</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">as it's clear and as other speakers have mentioned this will be a different type of debate that we will have in the autumn time because we have now the euh context of a European election set in the worst economic condition for the last sixty years if not worse </s>    <s id="1:3">die Vorredner haben schon darauf hingewiesen dass die Debatte anders aussieht als die Debatte im Herbst und wir stehen ja auch vor den Europawahlen und haben die schlimmsten wirtschaftlichen Bedingungen der letzten sechziger Jahre</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">I think therefore euh when it comes mister Surján to looking at the budget in the autumn time you've set out traditional challenges in this document </s>    <s id="1:4">und Herr Surján wenn's dann im Herbst wieder um den Haushalt geht dann haben wir zwar die traditionelle Herausforderung in ihrem Dokument</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">my suspicion is there'll be much change by the debates we are going to have of focusing where we're going to be able to be having new jobs for the future rather than looking backwards </s>    <s id="1:5">aber ich glaube die Debatte wird doch anders laufen der darum gehen wo neue zukunftsorientierte Arbeitsplätze enstehen können und wir sollten nicht rückwärts gewandt sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">so I think the real emphasis will be on things that you have in your document on green technologies on zero carbon euh euh technologies </s>    <s id="1:6">also euh grüne Technologie euh CO2-freie Entwicklungen</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and above all on seeing how ICT can foster innovation and euh being able to get the new growth that the European economy will be needed </s>    <s id="1:7">und euh insbesondere Innovationen und Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien um neues Wachstum für die EU zu schaffen</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">but mister Maňka too euh in the budget for the European Parliament when we're thinking about the screening process which has just been mentioned please do not forget the role of technologies and the way in which everything can be done in a much simpler kind of way</s>    <s id="1:8">im Haushalt fährt das Europäische Parlament im Zusammenhang mit euh dem euh Screening-Verfahren das gerade angesprochen wurde sollten wir nicht vergessen welche Rolle Technologie spielen kann also dass vieles vereinfacht werden kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">we don't need traditional ways of doing it </s>    <s id="1:9">wir brauchen nicht immer die traditionellen Verfahren verwenden</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">we need to be thinking of the new ways that we can be able to communicate with our citizens </s>    <s id="1:10">neue Kommunikationsformen auch mit euh in der Kommunikation mit dem Bürger</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">I suspect at the end of the next Parliament every Parliamentarian barring one or two will have a blog</s>    <s id="1:11">und ich glaube euh alle bis auf ein oder zwei euh Abgeordnete werden bis in der nächsten Legislaturperiode ihren eigenen Blog haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">there are over one hundred million blogs in the global system today</s>    <s id="1:12">es gibt schon euh zweihundert</s>
#
     <s id="1:13"> there weren't any blogs when this Parliament started out in two thousand and four</s>    <s id="1:13">zweitausendvier gab's die noch überhaupt nicht</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">we have to have our minds tuned to the future rather than trampling along the normal kind ways which we are used to in many kind of context </s>    <s id="1:14">wir sollten wirklich zukunftsorientiert sein und nicht in traditioneller Art und Weise euh weitermachen wollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">lastly I'd like to support mister Surján's proposal very strongly 'cause it refers to both budgets to what I call value for money and others call qualitative improvement of the way in which we spend it</s>    <s id="1:15">dann möchte ich den Vorschlag von Herrn Surján ganz nachdrücklich aufgreifen der sich auf beide Haushalte bezieht nämlich einen Gegenwert zu finden beziehungsweise positive Weiterentwicklungen unseres Ausgabenverhalten</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">the economic recession will be very tough on us to be able to justify the monies which we're spending </s>    <s id="1:16">die Rezession wird sicher eine ausreichende Rechtfertigung sein um unsere Ausgaben zu überdenken</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">I'd therefore like to thank the Commissioner for everything that she has done during her term of office to be able to monitor how spending is done</s>    <s id="1:17">ich möchte mich auch bei der Kommission bedanken für das was sie in ihrer Mandatszeit getan haben um die Ausgaben zu verbessern</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">NONE</s>    <s id="1:18">und wir sollten jetzt auch beim Beginn der neuen Legislaturperiode über euh die Ausgaben</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">so if you can for the new Parliament coming in have an analysis of those lines which are strong and which are weak</s>    <s id="1:19">NONE</s>

     <s id="1:2">I too would like to welcome this report </s>    <s id="1:2">ich möchte ebenfalls diesen Bericht begrüßen</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">hum about eighty per cent of all new jobs in the European Union have been created by SMEs</s>    <s id="1:3">euh acht Prozent der neuen Arbeitsplätze in der EU werden in euh von KMUs gegründet</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">and in my own constituency of Dublin about four hundred thousand people are employed by about one hundred thousand companies in the SME sector</s>    <s id="1:4">vierhunderttausend Menschen in Dublin werden von einhunderttausend Firmen im KMU-bereich beschäftigt</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">we must do all we possibly can at the moment to support these companies in difficult times </s>    <s id="1:5">wir müssen wirklich alles in unserer Macht stehende unternehmen um diese Firmen in schwieirgen Zeiten zu unterstützen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">I welcome the fact that the EIB has a fund of thirty one billion euh for small to medium-sized industries</s>    <s id="1:6">ich begrüße die Tatsache dass es einunddreißig Milliarden bei der EIB für die KMUs gibt</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and I think that more should be done in this area</s>    <s id="1:7">und ich meine dass in diesem Bereich mehr getan werden soll</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">also the cutting of red tape and bureaucracy by the Commission has to be welcomed</s>    <s id="1:8">hum dass Bürokratie euh heruntergebracht wird das muss man begrüßen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">hum there's a saving of that for the European Union is about two point three million</s>    <s id="1:9">euh das wäre eine Einsparung in der Höhe von zwei Komma drei Millionen euh für die euh EU</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and recently I had a meeting with Commissioner Verheugen and we discussed with Irish business people the problems that they faced</s>    <s id="1:10">und ich habe mit euh Kommissar Verheugen mit irischen Geschäftsleuten ihre Probleme diskutiert</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and one of them I think that should be looked at is that we should look at the idea of maybe having a moratorium on red tape on new red tape that's coming out from Europe because that is stifling business</s>    <s id="1:11">und was man sich hier ansehen sollte ist dass man dran denken sollte an eine Stundung euh bei neuer Bürokratie und der neuen Verwaltungsaufgaben und Belastungen zu haben denn das erwürgt unsere Unternehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and during these difficult times we have to do everything we possibly can to make sure that they survive euh hm to what hopefully will be an upturn</s>    <s id="1:12">da müssen wir wirklich jetzt alles tun um sicherzustellen dass sie in Zeiten wie diesen euh in einen Aufschwung hinein hoffentlich überleben</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but that cannot only be done by Europe</s>    <s id="1:13">aber das darf jetzt nicht nur Europa machen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">it must also be done by national governments and by hum local government because they themselves  hum have a huge role to play in this</s>    <s id="1:14">das müssen auch die nationalen Regierungen machen und die euh lokalen Körperschaften denn auch sie haben eine ganz große Rolle dabei zu spielen</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and if we want to get our small businesses and get employment hum to stabilize in the European Union and in each individual member state we must do everything we possibly can to try and save them</s>    <s id="1:15">und wenn wir es erleben wollen dass unsere euh kleinen Unternehmen mittleren Unternehmen euh es schaffen die Beschäftigung in der EU in den Mittelstaaten zu stabilisieren dann müssen wir wirklich alles unternehmen um zu versuchen sie selbst zu reiten</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">the hum this challenge that we have at the moment is about jobs jobs jobs and we must bend over backwards to try and protect existing employment and hopefully in the years ahead try and create new jobs</s>    <s id="1:16">die Herausforderung für uns euh bezieht sich auf Jobs Jobs Jobs und wir müssen da wirklich alles in unserer Macht stehende tun um euh die jetzige Beschäftigung zu schützen und auch neue Arbeitsplätze hoffentlich in Zukunft zu schaffen</s>

#
     <s id="1:2">the fact that seventy per cent of private employment in Europe is provided by SMEs is a tremendous tribute to their entrepreneurial tenacity because oppressive EU regulation makes their life unnecessarily and extremely difficult</s>    <s id="1:2">die Tatsache dass siebzig Prozent privaten euh Beschäftigungshältnisse in Europa von KMUs euh stammt ist ja ein euh riesen euh Beweis ihrer unternehmerischen Ausdauer denn euh unterdrückerische EU-Rechtsvorschriften machen deren Leben unnötig schwierig</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">hence I would repeat a call I've made before that during the currency of this economic downturn there should be a regulation holiday for SMEs </s>    <s id="1:3">deswegen möchte ich eine Aufforderung wiederholen die ich schonmal gemacht habe nämlich dass euh während dieser Wirtschaftsflaute es euh eine euh Rechtsvorschriftenurlaub sagen wir geben sollte dass da keine EU-Vorschriften mehr kommen sollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">the cost of EU regulation in the United Kingdom has been reckoned to be one hundred and seven billion Pounds over the last ten years</s>    <s id="1:4">die Kosten von EU-Vorschriften im Vereinigten Königreich allein wurden dahingehend berechnet dass das einhundertsieben Milliarden Pfund ausmacht was die letzten zehn Jahre betrifft</s>

     <s id="1:5">that is one hundred and seven billion that should've been going into innovation into intensified export efforts and into growth </s>    <s id="1:5">das sind einhundertsieben Milliarden die eigtnlich in Innovation hätten gesteckt werden sollen oder in intensivierte Exportaktivitäten und ins Wachstum</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and yet much of that has had to be spent on mere compliance with regulation </s>    <s id="1:6">trotzdem ist es so dass sehr viel davon einfach euh euh dafür ausgegeben werden musste um irgendwelchen Vorschriften zu entsprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:7"> the simplification of procurement procedures reducing patent costs relaxation on state aid rules and real action against unfair competition from the far east are all essential if SMEs are to flourish</s>    <s id="1:7">eine Vereinfachung der öffentlichen Auftragsvergabevorschriften euh Reduzierung der Kosten für Patente Lockerung der Vorschriften für staatlichen Beihilfen und auch euh Reaktionen auf unfairen Wettbewerb aus dem fernen euh Osten das wär wichtig für die KMUs</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">today we need family SMEs small businesses more than ever because they have the type of commitment and sticking power to get us through this crisis</s>    <s id="1:8">wir brauchen heute euh Familienbetriebe kleine Betriebe mehr denn je denn sie haben die Art von Engagment und auch die Hartnäckigkeit um uns durch diese Krise durchzubringen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">but we they need our help and they need it by lifting the dead hand of EU regulation from them </s>    <s id="1:9">aber wir brauchen euh deren Hilfe und sie brauchen unsere Hilfe das heißt wir sollten die tote Hand der EU-Regelungen euh von ihnen wegnehmen</s>

     <s id="1:2">I rise to challenge mister Allister and what he said earlier in his ludicrous comments about the supposed costs of EU regulation to businesses and in particular British businesses</s>    <s id="1:2">also ich möchte Herrn Allister doch gerne hier herausfordern im Bezug auf seine lächerlichen Bemerkungen über die vermutlichen Kosten der EU-Rechtsvorschriften für Unternehmen insbesondere britische Unternehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">these are based on hm some so-called studies which are being hawked around the British Eurosceptic press at the moment with ever more lurid calculations about these costs</s>    <s id="1:3">da stützt man sich auf so genannte Studien die da in der euh gesamten euroskeptischen britischen Presse mit noch lächerlicheren Berechnungen herumgereicht wird welche Kosten da überhaupt anfallen und wie die gemacht werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">but these studies are wrong on three counts</s>    <s id="1:4">aber in dreierlei irren sich diese Studien</s>

     <s id="1:5">first they exaggerate the amount of legislation that's adopted at EU level instead of national level quoting fifty per cent or more whereas most national studies show it's between six and fifteen per cent </s>    <s id="1:5">erstens wird die Gesetzgebung auf EU-Ebene nicht auf nationaler Ebene euh überzogen weshalb da fünfzig Prozent oder mehr den meisten nationalen Studien dass das zwischen sechs und fünfzehn Prozent sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">secondly it takes no count of the fact that EU legislation when we get it right cuts costs to businesses and cuts red tape by having a single set of standards common rules for the common market instead of twenty seven divergent and separate ones </s>    <s id="1:6">zweitens euh wird nicht berücksichtigt dass EU-Regelwerk wenn wir es richtig machen eigentlich die Kosten senken und die Bürokratie verringern für die Unternehmen weil doch einheitliche Vorschriften für'n Binnenmarkt vorhanden sind anstelle dass da siebenundzwanzig getrennte Divergierende vorhanden sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and thirdly it makes no account of the fact that when we do impose costs it is often deliberate in order to save money downstream when we require cigarettes to have a health warning system when we euh require asbestos to be phased out of our products and our workplace it's in order to cut health costs and save lives for the people downstream</s>    <s id="1:7">und drittens wird überhaupt nicht berücksichtigt dass wenn wir schon euh Kosten auferlegen dann wird das ganz bewusst gemacht um weiter unten dann oder nachgeschaltet euh Kosten einzusparen wenn zum Beispiel Zigaretten Gesundheitswarnungenarbeitsplätzen und der Produktion verschwinden dann eben um die Gesundheitskosten euh später einmal euh zu senken und Leben zu retten</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">these studies cynically make no attempt to balance up the whole picture</s>    <s id="1:8">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">NONE</s>    <s id="1:9">aber das versucht man ja nie bei diesen Leuten die versuchen dieses ganze Bild zu zeigen</s>

     <s id="1:12">we've seen record fines euh put into operation by the Commission and we've seen record activity in terms of mergers and state aid notifications as well</s>    <s id="1:12">wir sehen wirklich euh riesen Geldbußen und wir sehen hier wirklich Rekordstrafen und auch euh Rekordaktivität euh was euh euh euh Übernahmen und Fusionen angeht</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and this is a process that is gathering pace in terms of modernization because the Commission is currently bringing forward proposals in a white paper on introducing private damages</s>    <s id="1:13">euh die Kommission ist übrigens auch dabei in ihrem euh Weißbuch dafür zu sorgen dass zum Beispiel euh Privatschäden mit euh ausgeglichen werden können</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">euh and that's something similarly that our committee and the Parliament has been supportive of</s>    <s id="1:14">das ist etwas euh was uns ganz besonders am Herzen liegt</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">our committee's drawn attention to two specific concerns what we regard as being the unequal relationship between producers and retailers particu1larly in relation to food retailing</s>    <s id="1:15">aber es gibt noch zwei andere Dinge die ganz besonders wichtig sind was uns angeht um eine gesunde Beziehung zwischen euh Erzeugern und dem Vertrieb zu bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">you mister president will recall that Parliament has in fact put down a written declaration on this signed by more than half of the members and also our committee's expressed some concern about abusive practices in the services sector </s>    <s id="1:16">was den euh Lebensmittelerzeuger angeht so wissen Sie dass hier mehr als die Hälfte unserer Abgeordneten eine Erklärung hierzu unterschrieben haben um missbräuchliche euh euh Strategien in diesem Bereich und auch im Dienstleistungsbereich zu unterbinden</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">but I mention the change of context because of course we all recognize that since euh the reports were published by the Commission the Commission's work in terms of state aid particu1arly has really taken on a rather different dimension </s>    <s id="1:17">wir wissen aber nun dass seit euh Veröffentlichung der Berichte durch die Kommission die Kommission sich auch speziell euh euh außereinandergesetzt hat mit Fragen der staatlichen Beihilfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">almost on a daily basis the Commission's now looking at the effect of the bail-outs that are taking place  in the context of the great financial turmoil that is being undertaken</s>    <s id="1:18">das ist mittlerweile etwas was euh fast zur tagtäglichen Arbeit der Kommission in diesem Bereich gehört und euh ganz besonders natürlich jetzt aufgrund euh der finanziellen Krise in der wir uns befinden</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and it's very important and our report says so that in addressing those matters we recognize some of the challenges that there are for an effective open market</s>    <s id="1:19">und euh eins ist klar wenn man sich mit diesen Dingen auseinandersetzt dann sieht man es gibt ja eine echte Herausforderung es gibt hier echte Hindernisse für ein effektiven offenen Binnenmarkt</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">euh it's very important that when the Commission gives its approval it's giving that approval in ways which are compatible with the treaty and do not create such significant market power in future that that becomes a scenario for abuse in its own right </s>    <s id="1:20">das heißt wenn die Kommission euh jetzt ihre Zustimmung gibt dann tut sie das nur wenn das euh dem euh Vertrag entspricht und nicht euh wenn es eine mögliche Verzerrung in der Zukunft bedeuten könnte und das ist euh etwas was ganz besonders wichtig ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:21"> just looking at the banking sector in the United Kingdom at the moment is one very very clear area where there will have to be when economic circumstances become a little calmer a general review of the new architecture that we have got and whether that architecture really is compatible with the operation of a free fair and open market</s>    <s id="1:21">denken wir allein an den Bankensektor im vereinigten Königreich im Augenblick da sieht man dass dies ein Bereich ist in dem ganz klar euh die euh wirtschaftliche Situation sich etwas euh beruhigt haben muss um euh zu sehen ob die bestehende Architektur euh tatsächlich verträglich ist euh mit euh einem freien offenen und fairen Markt euh</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">euh we have received reassurances from Commissioner Kroes in this regard</s>    <s id="1:22">euh hm Frau euh Kommissarin Kroes hat uns bestätigt euh dass das der Fall sei</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">but nonetheless our committee has put those pointers down in this report but generally our view is that the Commission is to be congratulated euh in its work and that's the thrust of the report which I anticipate will be passed tomorrow by a very large majority</s>    <s id="1:23">aber in unserem Ausschuss haben wir gesagt das muss weiterverfolgt werden aber insgesamt euh wollen wir unseren Glückwunsch euh und unsere Befriedigung ausdrücken an die Kommissarin und diese Entscheidung wird von vielen von uns mitgetragen</s>

#
     <s id="1:3">and also we should say I think in the absence of Council as well that hum euh the negotiations there I think have been tough but fair and we have a very good outcome</s>    <s id="1:3">und euh euh auch in Abwesenheit des Rates möchte ich jetzt hier sagen dass die Verhandlungen euh ja hart waren aber fair und das Ergebnis sehr gut ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">now I want to euh just pick up a number of points euh that build on what the Commissioner said because hum I'm been privileged to be part of the CARS 21 initiative from the very beginning</s>    <s id="1:4">ich möchte jetzt ein paar Punkte herausgreifen ausgehend von dem was auch die Kommission gesagt hat denn ich hatte das Privileg zu Cars 21 zu gehören von Anfang an</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and I think we're now seeing the impact of that integrated approach</s>    <s id="1:5">und euh wenn man jetzt sieht euh welche Auswirkungen dieser integrierte Ansatz hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and euh I think this is in an important terminology and this is a classic example about how a number of different provisions have been brought together euh in an update a rolling update hum of the regulatory framework affecting motor vehicles but one which the industry is expecting</s>    <s id="1:6">das ist doch eigentlich auch ein wichtiger Begriff hier ein klassisches Beispiel euh dazu wie eine Reihe von Bestimmungen hier zusammengeführt worden sind eine Aktualisierung erreicht worden ist des derzeitigen Regelrahmens für euh Fahrzeuge das euh hm haben wir aber das was die euh Industrie erwartet hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">we set down a road map in CARS 21 about the environmental and safety challenges that we expected the industry to meet</s>    <s id="1:7">wir haben eine Roadmap euh entworfen in Cars 21 zu den Umwelt und Sicherheitsherausforderungen denen die Industrie nachkommen sollte</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and the crucial thing there is to give them stability and knowledge so they can plan and design the new products in a sensible and sequenced way certainly with demanding deadlines and targets</s>    <s id="1:8">und das wichtigste ist doch hier dass die auch Stabilität an die Hand bekommen und auch planen können und neue Produkte entwerfen können und zwar euh konsequent mit gewissen euh Fristen natürlich und Zielen die auch streng sein müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">we don't want to resile from those challenging targets but actually to give them that stability</s>    <s id="1:9">wir möchten darauf ja nicht verzichten und zurückstecken aber sie müssen Planungssicherheit haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and at the moment euh as euh Günter Verheugen pointed out with the industry in euh such a dire position because of a lack of demand that regulatory stability is crucially important </s>    <s id="1:10">und euh Günter Verheugen hat es jetzt auch gerade gesagt es ist wichtig euh gerade in einer so schweren euh Situation für die Industrie aufgrund der mangelnden Nachfrage da ist diese Stabilität ganz ausschlaggebend</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">I just highlight two points madam President</s>    <s id="1:11">zwei Dinge möchte ich hervorheben Frau Präsidentin</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">I think euh first of all the agreement to euh bring in electronic stability control systems at the earliest possible date is a very major contribution to safety</s>    <s id="1:12">zunächst einmal dass euh Übereinkommen dass euh die Elektronische Stabilitätskontrolle ESC hereingebracht werden sollten das ist ganz wichtig ein wichtiger Sicherheitsbeitrag</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and I really welcome that those of us who had the opportunity to test those systems will understand their efficiency</s>    <s id="1:13">das begrüße ich sehr diejenigen von uns die das mal haben testen können die werden feststellen wie effizient die sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">but secondly I want to highlight issues around the international framework the repeal of the EU directives and their incorporation into national legislation</s>    <s id="1:14">zweitens möchte ich hervorheben wie wichtig auch euh dieser ganze internationale Rahmen ist also euh die euh euh hm Streichung der alten Richtlinien und jetzt der Verweis auf die internationale Gesetzgebung</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">I do welcome that</s>    <s id="1:15">das begrüße ich</s>
#
     <s id="1:16"> but I think it is now more important than ever Commissioner that that process becomes much more transparent about the line that the Commission is taking on negotiating those directives which are being done in another body a UN body and not within this house </s>    <s id="1:16">viel wichtiger als das ist aber jetzt euh noch wichtiger als euh je zuvor dass das alles transparent ist die Linie der Kommission bei der Aushandlung dieser Richtlinien das wurde ja in einem UN-Gremium gemacht und nicht hier</s>

     <s id="1:2">could I begin by congratulating mister Schwab on his report and thanking him for his extremely  cooperative approach to euh this whole matter</s>    <s id="1:2">zunächst mal möchte ich Herrn Schwab gratulieren zu seinem Bericht und ich möchte ihm auch danken für seinen extrem kooperativen Ansatz bei diesem Thema</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">madam President euh last Thursday night a colleague of ours Linda McAvan was involved in a very serious car accident </s>    <s id="1:3">Frau Präsidentin letzten Donnerstagabend hat Linda McAvon euh an euh war sie an einem schweren Autounfall beteiligt</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">her car was destroyed but she walked away relatively unhurt           </s>    <s id="1:4">ihr Auto wurde zerstört aber sie kam relativ ungeschoren davon</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">why</s>    <s id="1:5">warum</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">because the car she was driving had the most modern safety features </s>    <s id="1:6">weil das Auto das sie fuhr die modernsten Sicherheitsmerkmale überhaupt aufwies</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and that enabled her not to be seriously injured </s>    <s id="1:7">und deswegen ist sie nicht ernsthaft verletzt worden</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">now that is the context in which we are discussing this report</s>    <s id="1:8">das ist jetzt der Kontext indem wir uns bewegen und im Bericht besprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">road safety saves lives as Commissioner Verheugen euh commented on and is so important euh to the well-being of many families in the European Union </s>    <s id="1:9">hum Sicherheit im Straßenverkehr euh schützt Leben das hat Herr Kommissar Verheugen gesagt und euh die Sicherheit im Straßenverkehr ist sehr wichtig für das Wohlergehen vieler Familien in der Europäischen Union</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and we shouldn't lose sight of that even in these difficult times</s>    <s id="1:10">das sollten wir nicht aus den Augen verlieren auch nicht in diesen schwierigen Zeiten</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and we do have to recognize they are very difficult </s>    <s id="1:11">und wir müssen anerkennen die Zeiten sind im Moment wirklich schwierig</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and that is why I was determined to oppose those people in this Parliament and in the Council who wanted to weaken this Commission proposal</s>    <s id="1:12">deswegen war ich auch entschlossen Widerstand zu leisten gegen diejenigen im Parlament und dem Rat die diesen Kommissionsvorschlag schwächen wollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13"> because I believe the Commission original proposal is a very good one</s>    <s id="1:13">der ursprüngliche Vorschlag der Kommission ist nämlich meines Erachtens sehr gut</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and we were determined to resist it</s>    <s id="1:14">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">there was one main weakness however in the Commission proposal and that is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date </s>    <s id="1:15">es gab aber eine Hauptschwäche im Kommissionsvorschlag es gab nämlich keine Bestimmungen für den Weiterverkauf euh von Reifen die euh die neuen euh Auflagen nach dem Umsetzungsdatum nicht erfüllten</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and I believe that is a major flaw </s>    <s id="1:16">das ist ein Hauptfehler</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">that is why I proposed to the committee and the committee accepted an amendment that said these tyres that did not meet the standards after the implementation date should be sold off after twelve months </s>    <s id="1:17">und deswegen habe ich dem Ausschuss vorgeschlagen der Ausschuss hat das auch akzeptiert einen Änderungsantrag einzureichen im Hinblick auf euh den Weiterverkauf dieser Reifen nach zwölf Monaten</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">however in the current circumstances of the car industry given that cars are not being sold it was quite clear in the discussions we had with Council that in fact these twelve months was probably unrealistic</s>    <s id="1:18">in den jetzigen Umständen euh ist es aber so dass die Automobilbranche euh Probleme hat euh wegen mangelndem Verkaufs von Neuwagen und in den Gesprächen mit dem Rat ist klar geworden dass diese zwölf Monate unrealistisch sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and we had to consider the serious environmental consequences of getting rid of tyres euh which are perfectly good and sound </s>    <s id="1:19">euh wir müssen uns auch Gedanken machen über euh die umweltpolitischen Folgen wenn also euh Reifen euh entsorgt werden obwohl sie noch gut sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">and therefore we were prepared to accept in the trialogue thirty months as being the period before tyres not meeting these requirements euh should be sold off after the implementation date</s>    <s id="1:20">deswegen haben wir dreißig Monate akzeptiert euh in der Vermittlung erst nach dreißig Monaten dürfen Reifen die die Auflagen nicht erfüllen weiterverkauft werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">but of course euh thanks to the intervention of mister Schwab euh if the Commission believes that there could be an earlier date that is provided for in the comitology euh procedure</s>    <s id="1:21">aber wenn die Kommission glaubt ein früheres Datum ist möglich euh dann ist das im Rahmen des Komitologieverfahrens möglich</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">so I think that was an important area of strengthening </s>    <s id="1:22">das euh ist also eine deutliche Verstärkung des Berichtes</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">I would draw attention to the important environmental measures particularly tyre pressure monitoring systems which will A save on CO2 but also will make cars safer 'cause under-inflated car tyres are a euh cause of many accidents</s>    <s id="1:23">hinweisen möchte ich auf die wichtigen umweltpolitischen Maßnahmen vor allem euh im Hinblick auf die Reifendrucküberwachungssysteme die CO2 einsparen die Autos aber auch sicherer machen denn euh Reifen mit zu geringem Luftdruck sind oft die Ursache von Unfällen</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">and that I believe euh is very important</s>    <s id="1:24">das ist also wichtig festzuhalten</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">we have reduced euh rolling resistance</s>    <s id="1:25">wir haben den Rollwiderstand reduziert</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">we have euh included gear shift indicators in this proposal which wasn't in the original euh proposal </s>    <s id="1:26">wir haben euh auch euh Getriebeeinrichtungen euh moderne Getriebesysteme vorgesehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">these will not only benefit the environment but they will actually save the motorists money it is his cash in people's pockets which is very important at this time</s>    <s id="1:27">euh das euh spart Geld denn euh spart Geld wirklich für die Endverbraucher das ist in den jetzigen Zeiten besonders wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">the point about safety is well made as I say tyre pressure monitoring systems are very important because under-inflated tyres and much to my shame I believe the United Kingdom is one of the worst culprits in having under-inflated tyres is a cause euh of accidents </s>    <s id="1:28">euh zum Thema Sicherheit habe ich was gesagt auch zum Rollwiderstand zu den Reifendrucküberwachungssystemen euh ich glaube das Vereinigte Königreich eine der Hauptschuldigen also da gibt es oft euh Reifen mit zu wenig euh hum Reifendruck</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">but also lane departure warning systems and the electronic stability control</s>    <s id="1:29">aber dieses elektronische Stabilitätssystem ist wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">and I congratulate mister Schwab  for bringing that forward and implementation by a year because I think that will be a major euh euh advantage in terms of safety</s>    <s id="1:30">Danke an Herrn Schwab dass er das angesprochen hat auch im Rahmen der Umsetzung denn es ist wirklich einer der Hauptvorteile in Sachen Sicherheit</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">as mister Harbour and the Commissioner's pointed out simplification is a part of this proposal and I think is very important </s>    <s id="1:31">Herr Harbour und die Kommission haben es bereits gesagt die Vereinfachung ist Teil des Vorschlags es ist auch sehr wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">and finally euh I would draw attention to what we've done in terms of euh in demanding greater euh emphasis in road services in reducing noise</s>    <s id="1:32">und guter letzt möchte ich noch hinweisen auf das was wir unternommen haben im Hinblick darauf dass wir stärker den Fokus legen auf Lärmreduzierung</s>
#
     <s id="1:33"> because noise road traffic noise is a cause of stress</s>    <s id="1:33">denn euh Lärm im Straßenverkehr führt zu Stress</s>
#
     <s id="1:34">and stress is a cause of ill health and indeed fatalities </s>    <s id="1:34">Stress führt euh euh zu Gesundheitsprobleme oder sogar Todesfällen</s>
#
     <s id="1:35">and it's therefore important we should address that </s>    <s id="1:35">deswegen müssen wir uns dem Thema stellen</s>

     <s id="1:6">but on this occasion I was pleased to be persuaded because this proposal contains provisions which both improve road safety and happily assist a company in Northern Ireland which is at the cutting edge of technology and production of tyre pressure monitoring systems</s>    <s id="1:6">aber hier bin ich überzeugt worden denn dieser Vorschlag enthält Bestimmungen die die Straßenverkehrssicherheit euh euh fördern und auch ein Unternehmen unterstützen in Nordirland das euh hochmoderne Reifendrucküberwachungssysteme euh produziert</s>

     <s id="1:7"> thus a proposal which makes the fitting of such systems mandatory is not just good for road safety but good for jobs in my constituency</s>    <s id="1:7">und euh von daher ist dieses euh System hier gut für die Sicherheit im Straßenverkehr und auch für die Arbeitsplätze in meinem Wahlbezirk</s>

     <s id="1:1">the idea behind the IPPC directive was to enable us to achieve maximum environmental benefit for minimum cost giving much flexibility to industry and to member states </s>    <s id="1:1">ja der Gedanke hinter dieser Richtlinie behält ja dass wir möglichst große Umweltvorteile für wenig Kosten bekommen und dass die Industrie und die Mitgliedsstaaten möglichst Flexibilität bekommen</s>

     <s id="1:1">thank you mister President</s>    <s id="1:1">danke Herr Präsident</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">Commission colleagues</s>    <s id="1:2">euh werte Kommissionskolleginnen Kollegen</s>
#
     <s id="1:3"> as a member of the Agriculture Committee I will restrict my remarks to the impact of this proposal on the farming sector across the European Union </s>    <s id="1:3">als Mitglieds des Landwirtschaftsausschusses möcht ich mich beschränken auf die Folgen des Vorschlags für die Landwirtschaft in der gesamten Eurpäischen Union</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">and I would endorse the comments of other colleagues who have concerns about spreading the net if you like and dragging farmers into euh coverage as industrial polluters </s>    <s id="1:4">und ich möchte unterstützen was verschiedene Kolleginnen und Kollegen schon gesagt haben und die Sorgen haben zwei Landwirte jetzt hier euh genau so behandelt werden wie sollen Industrieverschmutzer</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and obviously for agriculture must be monitored for its emissions</s>    <s id="1:5">die Verschmutzung muss natürlich überwacht werden in der Industrie und überall</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">but I don't accept that we should do it in this way</s>    <s id="1:6">aber ich akzeptiere nicht dass das so passieren muss</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and I would suggest that the Nitrates Directive in its current form does much of what we're talking about</s>    <s id="1:7">und ich würde vorschlagen dass die Nitratrichtlinie in ihrer jetzigen Form viel von dem tut worüber wir hier reden</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">but perhaps we need to look at the Nitrates Directive which is causing problems in many member states in how it's being implemented and whether it is being effectively implemented</s>    <s id="1:8">aber euh die Nitratrichtlinie führt ja zu Problemen in vielen Mitlgiedsstaaten vor allem bei der Umsetzung da müssen wir uns überlegen ob diese Richtlinie wirklich richtig und effizient umgesetzt wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and perhaps that proposal might be looked at </s>    <s id="1:9">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">NONE</s>    <s id="1:10">das sollte man sich mal überlegen</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">euh in addition to that there are concerns about dragging in poultry in particular</s>    <s id="1:11">außerdem euh muss man sich Sorgen machen wegen der Geflügelzucht</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">because that sector hum in the European context is under huge threat from imports from third countries where no such restrictions apply</s>    <s id="1:12">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">NONE</s>    <s id="1:13">denn diese Branche im europäischen Kontext steht unter großen Bedrohungen wegen der Einfuhren aus Drittstaaten wo es solche Einschränkungen gibt</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and I would support amendments that say that this should not happen in the current proposals </s>    <s id="1:14">und ich unterstütze Änderungsanträge die besagen dass das in dem Vorschlag hier nicht euh euh sein sollte</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">likewise the inclusion of dairy farming is of concern</s>    <s id="1:15">außerdem euh ist die euh Behandlung der Milchwirtschaft euh euh Anlass zur Sorge</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">so I would support colleagues in my own group and others who hum are euh have amendments tabled to take these out of the current proposal</s>    <s id="1:16">von daher unterstütze ich Änderungsanträge die dies aus dem jetzigen Vorschlag herausnehmen sollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and I would repeat my suggestion that when it comes to agriculture there is a myriad of directives covering emissions and pollution control in this sector</s>    <s id="1:17">und ich wiederhole nochmal in Sachen Landwirtschaft gibt's eine Vielzahl von Richtlinien über Verschmutzungskontrolle Emissionen und so weiter</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and maybe it's time we looked at recasting all of those so that farmers who are required to implement them can fully understand and appreciate what they are meant to do</s>    <s id="1:18">und es ist wirklich an der Zeit all diese Richtlinien mal zu überarbeiten sodass Landwirte die sie umsetzen müssen wirklich auch verstehen was sie tun sollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">because it is one thing to draft legislation as we do in this house but we sometimes have no connection with how it's implemented and by whom it's being implemented and whether that implementation is effective</s>    <s id="1:19">denn es ist das eine Rechtsvorschriften zu entwerfen wie wir das hier im hohen Haus tun manchmal haben wir aber keine Verbindung mehr euh zur Umsetzung wir vergessen auch euh wer die Richtlinien umzusetzen hat ob sie effizient umgesetzt werden</s>

     <s id="1:1">thank you very much President</s>    <s id="1:1">ja vielen Dank</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">hum I'd like to start by congratulating my friend and colleague mister El Khadraoui who I think it's fair to say euh despite appearances suggesting the contrary has actually proved himself euh capable of producing a very sound and euh workable report</s>    <s id="1:2">ich möchte meinen euh Freund und euh Kollegen hum hm beglückwünschen denn er hat euh durchaus gezeigt dass er ein euh sehr ausgewogenen und euh guten Bericht euh vorgelegt hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">and I am happy to add my support euh to it and indeed to the underlying principle that the polluter should pay </s>    <s id="1:3">und ich kann ihn nur unterstützen hier ist das Prinzip euh Verursacherprinzip ganz klar enthalten</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">on this side of the house we attach great importance and are very concerned euh about air quality</s>    <s id="1:4">und euh wir sind natürlich euh bei der Luftqualität sehr besorgt</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and we all know that lorries pollute </s>    <s id="1:5">natürlich euh verschmutzen die euh Lastkraftwagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">misses Lichtenberger put it as there's documented evidence</s>    <s id="1:6">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">now misses Wortmann-Kool's left</s>    <s id="1:7">gut euh der Vorredner ist jetzt euh euh gegangen</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">euh she spoke about the obstacles to the internal market</s>    <s id="1:8">sie sprach über die Hemmnisse für den euh Markt</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and despite his report on greening of transport mister Jarzebowski also expressed euh reservations about Eurovignette</s>    <s id="1:9">und Herr Jarzembowski hat hier auch Bedenken geäußert euh zur Eurovignette</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">well I say to both of them that the biggest threat to all markets will be if we get overtaken by pollution</s>    <s id="1:10">gut ich kann beiden sagen dass die größte Bedrohung für beide euh Märkte darin bestehen dass die Verschmutzung alles euh beeinträchtigt</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">NONE</s>    <s id="1:11">es wird eine Belastung sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and I don't believe that an extra two to three per cent will be a huge burden</s>    <s id="1:12">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but it will show that we are taking serious steps to counter euh pollution</s>    <s id="1:13">aber es wird auch zeigen dass wir ganz klare Schritte unternehmen um die Verschmutzung zu reduzieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">now mister O´Neachtain euh expressed reservations and concerns about Ireland and other peripheral countries </s>    <s id="1:14">gut es wurden hier Bedenken im Zusammenhang mit Irland euh geäußert weil es in einer Randlage liegt</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">he seems not to understand that this is optional on member states</s>    <s id="1:15">aber es scheint dann nicht verstanden worden sein dass es eine Option ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">it'll only apply in Ireland if his government actually decides it</s>    <s id="1:16">euh die Regierung kann sich da ganz anders entscheiden</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and I think he and probably mister Bradbourn will have learnt one lesson this afternoon that it's dangerous and makes you look rather foolish to speak on a report that you either haven't read or you clearly don't understand</s>    <s id="1:17">Herr Bradbourn wird doch sicherlich heut Nachmittag gelernt haben dass es euh gefährlich ist über einen Bericht zu sprechen den man entweder nicht gelesen hat oder gar nicht verstanden hat da macht man sich lächerlich</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">as on another point as an aside I believe we should be and could do much more to encourage freight off the roads into the waterways but there's more of this</s>    <s id="1:18">ich meine dass wir noch viel machen mehr machen euh müssten um euh Verkehr von euh der Straße auf die Wasserwege bringen</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">George you wanna listen there's some more actually</s>    <s id="1:19">ja ich hab da noch mehr zu sagen Georg</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">hang on hum the thank you President thank you</s>    <s id="1:20">ja vielen Dank Herr Präsident</s>

#
     <s id="1:24">thank you president I was in mid sentence</s>    <s id="1:24">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">we should encourage more freight onto use our waterways where one barge can carry perhaps as much as fifteen lorries </s>    <s id="1:25">also es sollte mehr Fracht auf die Wasserwge gebracht werden ein Schiff kann da so viel transportieren wie fünfzig LKW</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">so I think we should support the initiative of our erstwhile Belgian colleague</s>    <s id="1:26">ich glaube wir sollten die Initiative wirklich mittragen</s>

     <s id="1:2">the term European solidarity has been bandied around this morning as if it were a given</s>    <s id="1:2">der Begriff europäische Solidarität wird heute Morgen hier wie euh ein Banner vor sich hergetragen</s>

     <s id="1:8">and yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling seems now to be an advocate of this plan </s>    <s id="1:8">aber euh der britische Finanzminister Darling euh scheint euh hier ein großer Verfechter dieses Plans zu sein</s>

     <s id="1:9">I think he's lost his marbles</s>    <s id="1:9">er ist vielleicht verrückt geworden</s>

     <s id="1:10">he says that this is the time for Europe to build on shared values of cooperation as if we're one big happy family </s>    <s id="1:10">er sagt jetzt muss Europa aufbauen auf gemeinsamen Werten der Zusammenarbeit als ob wir hier eine große glückliche Familie wären</s>

     <s id="1:2">I want to refer to our strategy and preparations for the Copenhagen Conference on climate change later this year where we have taken a leadership role but one which is threatened by the economic recession and demands that we relax our standards </s>    <s id="1:2">ich wollte mich gerne auf euh Strategie und Vorbereitungen für die Kopenhagener Konferenz über Klimawandel später im Jahr beziehen wo wir eine Führungsrolle übernommen haben eine die allerdings bedroht wird durch die Rezession und da werden ja Forderungen erhoben dass wir unsere Standards lockern</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">let me give you one example </s>    <s id="1:3">darf ich ein Beispiel euh anführen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">more than three years ago we agreed that new requirements would be placed on car manufacturers to change the air conditioning refrigerants they use which currently has a global warming potential one thousand four hundred times greater than carbon dioxide</s>    <s id="1:4">vor mehr als drei Jahren einigten wir uns dass neue Anforderungen auf die Autohersteller auferlegt würden um euh die euh Air-Conditioning-Einrichtungen zu ändern das ist jetzt im Moment tausend Mal ärger für das Klima als euh euh Kohlendioxid</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">we said that should take place in all new car models from two thousand and eleven</s>    <s id="1:5">und das sollte für alle neuen Automodelle ab zweitausendelf gelten</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">but now we hear that some manufacturers led I understand by Ford and General Motors are trying to exploit loopholes to get out of that obligation </s>    <s id="1:6">jetzt hören wir aber einige Kfz-Hersteller unter Führung von Ford und General Motors versuchen da jetzt Lücken zu finden um sich aus ihren Verpflichtungen rauszuschwindeln</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">later this month there is a meeting of the national type approval authorities</s>    <s id="1:7">später im Laufe des Monats wird es eine Sitzung der nationalen euh euh Bautypengenehmigungsbehörden geben</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">it's very important that Commissioner Verhofstadt takes a lead and makes it clear that we are not going to relax our standards that these refrigerants must be replaced by two thousand and eleven</s>    <s id="1:8">es ist hier wirklich wichtig dass hier ne Führungsrolle übernommen wird damit wir klar euh sagen dass wir unsere euh Standards nicht lockern und dass diese Gefriermittel einfach euh bis zweitausendzwölf weg sein müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">if we weaken now we open the floodgates to lobbying from industry across the board</s>    <s id="1:9">euh denn wenn wir das nicht machen wird die ganze Industrie uns lobbyen</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and our leadership role on climate change will be seriously undermined </s>    <s id="1:10">und unsere Führungsrolle beim Klimawandel wird dann ernsthaft unterminiert</s>

#
     <s id="1:4">she raised one or two questions right euh during her hum submission just now euh and her question about why more nurses 'n doctors are not coming forward</s>    <s id="1:4">sie hat wichtige Punkte angesprochen warum eben nicht mehr Pfleger und Ärzte zur Verfügung stellen</s>

     <s id="1:5">if I may say so I think that's half the question</s>    <s id="1:5">Frau Kommissarin das ist nur die halbe Frage</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">the other half is why so many are leaving </s>    <s id="1:6">die andere Hälfte der Frage lautet warum gehen so viele</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">because the key to this will be to find ways of recruiting and retaining hum healthcare professionals</s>    <s id="1:7">es hängt damit zusammen Personal einzustellen und auch zu halten</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">euh and that goes particularly perhaps for nurses euh but also for doctors and other euh therapists and so on </s>    <s id="1:8">im Gesundheitswesen gilt vielleicht vor allem für Pfleger aber doch auch für Ärzte und andere Therapeuten</s>

     <s id="1:9">and I think we have to look at hum the career structures that we provide</s>    <s id="1:9">wir müssen uns unbedingt einmal die Karriere und Laufbahnmöglichkeiten anschauen</s>

     <s id="1:10">euh we have to see how promotion euh hm is euh seen as a potential</s>    <s id="1:10">prüfen wie die Beförderung ausgeschöpft werden kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">euh we have to cut down some of the barriers within the professions between professions</s>    <s id="1:11">denn sie würde ja ein Potenzial bieten und auch die Schranken prüfen zwischen den verschiedenen Profis</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">we have to euh ensure that the work environment euh is pleasant</s>    <s id="1:12">und dafür sorgen dass das Arbeitsumfeld angenehm ist</s>

     <s id="1:14">and we have to make sure that euh research facilities are available euh in Europe so we don't lose people abroad</s>    <s id="1:14">wir müssen für Forschungseinrichtungen in Europa sorgen damit die Leute nicht abwandern in das Ausland wo die Forschungsbedingungen besser sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and perhaps above all we have to listen to the sharp-end professionals</s>    <s id="1:15">und wir müssen ein offenes Ohr haben für die Vertreter dieser Berufe</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">too often euh I know from when I've been in government and you know as a Commissioner we listen to the top people</s>    <s id="1:16">Sie wissen sicher eben so gut Frau Kommissarin wie ich dass wir immer nur euh den Leuten auf höherer Ebene zuhören</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">euh and we don't go down to the beds and listen to the nurses and the doctors who're actually dealing on the ground </s>    <s id="1:17">es geht aber um diejenigen die vor Ort arbeiten denen müssen wir mehr Gehör schenken in engeren Kontakt mit denen kommen um die Lage zu verbessern</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">if we did more of that then perhaps euh we'd get more of our policy right</s>    <s id="1:18">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">but I of course want to euh refer as the Commissioner has referred euh euh to my report euh the Parliament's consideration euh euh of cross-border health</s>    <s id="1:19">aber Sie bezogen sich auch auf meinen Bericht Frau Kommissarin die Überlegungen euh des Parlamentes im Bezug auf die grenzüberschreitende Gesundheitsversorgung</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">euh because we've said right from the beginning that important with that were the two measures that weren't coming at the same time</s>    <s id="1:20">ganz wichtig so hieß es von Anfang an ist es dass beide Maßnahmen gleichzeitig gefördert werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">now one of them of course was patient safety and we do have a measure that's hum sped its way on the fast track to join us </s>    <s id="1:21">zum Einen natürlich die Sicherheit der Patienten bei ihrer Versorgung das muss euh schnell geschehen ist auch schon auf dem Fast-Track</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">this one is somewhat behind it's the health professionals euh because euh we do need to have hum euh the health professionals euh euh hm providing that service that back-up to euh cross-border health to enable patients to move safely and with euh euh confidence </s>    <s id="1:22">aber das andere ist etwas in das Hintertreffen geraten das euh ist die Förderung der Gesundheitsarbeiter die ja schließlich verantwortlich sind dafür dass die Patienten sich vertrauensvoll und in Sicherheit grenzüberschreitend gesundheitlich versorgen zu lassen</s>

     <s id="1:24">the movement of euh health professionals she's euh referred to and we need to look at ways of making that a reality without endangering patient safety</s>    <s id="1:24">wir müssen das Ganze versuchen zu realisieren grenzübergreifende euh Gesundheitsversorgung der Patienten in voller Sicherheit in Europa</s>

     <s id="1:25">and I think that certainly includes the issue of euh language tests which are not an obstacle but must be a protective measure for euh patients</s>    <s id="1:25">NONE</s>

     <s id="1:26">NONE</s>    <s id="1:26">und die Sprache darf da kein Hindernis sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">euh she's referred to the euh recognition of qualifications</s>    <s id="1:27">Frau Kommissarin Sie sprachen auch von der Anerkennung der Qualifikationen</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">that clearly hum euh is important whether you're treated at home euh by an incoming euh euh hm doctor or you're going abroad to euh meet a local doctor there</s>    <s id="1:28">das ist eindeutig ein ganz wichtiger Punkt ein springender Punkt wenn ein Arzt im Ausland arbeiten will oder wenn man sich selber im Ausland euh fachlichen medizinischen Rat verschaffen will</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">and there's some professions and euh chiropractice is one where you have recognition in some countries and not in others</s>    <s id="1:29">denn es gibt die Anerkennung euh der Berufe der Qualifikationen in einigen Ländern aber nicht in allen</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">and we need to look at ways of bringing those euh euh if you like the ancillary hum health professionals euh into the centre of our planning</s>    <s id="1:30">und dann natürlich das Hilfspersonal im Gesundheitsbereich auch ganz wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">and we also of course need to be sure that we have patient safety in terms of doctors who are disciplined or struck off doctors nurses any health professionals</s>    <s id="1:31">auch hier die Anerkennung und die Patientensicherheit ist natürlich auch ganz wichtig im Hinblick auf Ärzte und Pfleger</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">euh and in my report I call for euh this to be facilitated by the Commission</s>    <s id="1:32">euh das Ganze muss erleichtert werden durch die Kommission</s>

#
     <s id="1:35">that we will look at development priorities such as the alleviation of poverty sustainable development economic diversification and the contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals at the five-year point to ensure that EPAs are working in the interests of all these things not against their interests </s>    <s id="1:35">hm euh dass wir Entwicklungsprioritäten euh im Auge behalten werden Bekämpfung der Armut wirtschaftliche Diversifizierung und ein Beitrag zu den Millenniumszielen dass man sicherstellt dass die EPAs auch wirklich im Interesse euh dieser euh Ziele funktionieren und nicht dagegen</s>

     <s id="1:37">in my opinion but of course I'm no expert on this but in my opinion this should be enough euh to meet the demands of the EPAs  if  they're properly programmed if the money is all spent if the Caribbean countries' priorities are euh met in terms of where the money should be spent</s>    <s id="1:37">ich bin da natürlich kein Experte aber meines Erachtens sollte das eigentlich als Summe ausreichen um hum den euh hm hm den Forderungen der EPAs nachzukommen wenn das ganze richtig programmiert wird wenn das Geld richtig ausgegeben wird wenn die Prioritäten der karibischen Länder wirklich eingehalten werden also mit Blick darauf wo die Gelder ausgegeben werden sollten</s>

     <s id="1:38">secondly we have to make sure that the member states deliver their part of the two billion that has been promised for aid for trade across euh the developing world </s>    <s id="1:38">zweitens müssen wir sicherstellen dass die Mitgliedsstaaten ihren Teil dieser zwei Milliarden auch entsprechend ausgeben die euh für die Handelshilfe vorgesehen sind  in den Entwicklungsländern</s>

     <s id="1:10">some people've said this should be just about development</s>    <s id="1:10">einige sagen es ginge nur um Entwicklung</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">I'm very much in favour of that</s>    <s id="1:11">das finde ich sehr positiv</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">but we have to bear in mind that one of the underlying requirements is it's actually about making our agreements with these countries WTO-compatible</s>    <s id="1:12">aber wir müssen auch daran denken dass es Anforderungen gibt letztendlich geht es bei diesen Anforderungen darum dass wir die Abkommen mit diesen Staaten euh WTO-kompatibel machen müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">now so we have to do that </s>    <s id="1:13">das müssen wir machen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">that's the first thing  </s>    <s id="1:14">das ist das Erste</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">on top of WTO-compatibility we must do whatever we can to try and improve the situation of these various regional blocks and to try and deal with the particular situations that actually face them</s>    <s id="1:15">zusätzlich zur WTO-Kompatibilität müssen wir alles in unserer Macht stehende tun um zu versuchen die Situation dieser verschiedenen regionalen Blocks zu verbessern wir müssen versuchen spezifischen Situationen Herr zu werden vor denen diese Länder stehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">with respect to the Pacific euh where I'm the rapporteur we have a collection of fourteen plus one if you include East Timor very small nation-states</s>    <s id="1:16">was den Pazifischen Raum anbelangt wo ich ja nun Berichterstatter bin euh da muss ich sagen dass wir euh vierzehn plus eins haben wenn wir Osttimor einschließen also vierzehn plus ein sehr kleine Nationalstaaten</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">euh one in fact is the smallest country in the world with a population that's exactly one million times less than that of China Nauru</s>    <s id="1:17">euh euh eins ist so winzig euh hum euh dass euh nur eine Millione euh euh Menschen umfasst Nauru</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">but even the biggest ones are actually comparatively small</s>    <s id="1:18">und andere auch die größten sind relativ klein</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and we need to take that into account in what requirements and demands we put on them</s>    <s id="1:19">und daran müssen wir denken wenn wir an sie Anforderungen stellen</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">we need to make sure there're adequate transition periods for small and medium-sized enterprises 'cause quite frankly apart from some mining enterprises in Papua New Guinea they're all small and medium enterprises </s>    <s id="1:20">wir müssen sicherstellen dass entsprechende Übergangszahlen euh geschaffen werden für die KMUs denn ganz offen abgesehen von einigen Bergbauunternehmen in Papua-Neuguinea sind das alles kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">we need to do what we can about regional trade and in particular take into account the special relationship countries of the Pacific have with Australia and with New Zealand</s>    <s id="1:21">wir müssen alles bezüglich des regionalen Handels tun und müssen die besonderen Beziehungen berücksichtigen die die Länder des Pazifischen Raumes mit Australien und mit Neuseeland haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">only two of the fourteen have actually signed up for the interim agreement but I know from my visit to Port Moresby euh euh at the last ACP meeting that there are other Pacific countries that would like to sign a final agreement providing it meets their requirements</s>    <s id="1:22">nur zwei der vierzehn Staaten euh euh euh euh kenne ich euh bei meinem euh durch meinen Besuch euh kenne ich euh aber es gibt euh das weiß ich aufgrund unseres Treffen in Port Moresby euh noch mehr die gerne unterzeichnen würden</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">hm which is why in my case I'm actually in favour of the interim agreement 'cause that's the message I get both from the governments of Papua New Guinea and Fiji </s>    <s id="1:23">ich bin für dieses Interimabkommen denn das ist die Botschaft die ich wirklich von euh der Regierung von Papua-Neuguinea und Fidschi bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">not that they're entirely happy</s>    <s id="1:24">nicht dass denen das alles wunderbar gefällt</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">there are issues that they'd like to renegotiate</s>    <s id="1:25">es gibt Einiges das sie gerne nachverhandeln würden</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">but they see the answer as being signing up and accepting an interim agreement which would lead towards a final agreement which will be more development friendly and will enable more of the Pacific countries to actually engage </s>    <s id="1:26">aber sie wollen unterzeichnen und sie wollen ein Interimabkommen akzeptieren was letztendlich zu einem vollständigen endgültigen hinführt was dann weiterentwickelt sein wird und was es mehr Ländern dieses Raumes möglich machen wird tätig zu werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">euh we also need to look at a number of specific issues that apply particular in Papua New Guinea and Fiji and elsewhere in the Pacific but may apply to some other of these agreements</s>    <s id="1:27">und wir sollten außerdem etliche Fragen berücksichtigen die vor allen Dingen für Papua-Neuguinea und Fidschi gelten aber vielleicht auch woanders im Pazifik es könnte auch sein dass sie für einige dieser Abkommen gelten</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">we need to look at intellectual property right negotiations that cover not only western technological artefacts but traditional knowledge</s>    <s id="1:28">wir müssen die Rechte des geistigen Eigentums berücksichtigen die Verhandlungen dort das geht ja nicht nur um Artefakte sondern es geht um traditionelles Wissen</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">we need to make sure that while there's a transparency of government procurement with an openness to European contracts triggered at a point appropriate to the needs of the euh of the Pacific nation-states</s>    <s id="1:29">wir müssen sicherstellen dass es eine Transparenz gibt beim öffentlichen Beschaffungswesen euh hm und euh auch wenn von europäischer Seite für dort Verträge abgeschlossen werden dass das auch dem Bedarf der Staaten dort Rechnung trägt</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">we need to look in the case of the Pacific particularly at working visas to be made available in the European Union to Pacific Island Nationals for periods of at least twenty four months for them to be able to work not in the higher professions but probably working as carers and in similar occupations</s>    <s id="1:30">wir müssen uns natürlich auch gerade um Arbeitsvisen kümmern für den Pazifischen Raum also hum euh dass euh die Menschen mindestens vierundzwanzig Monate bei uns arbeiten können euh nicht nur in den hochrangigen Berufen sondern auch in kleineren euh Berufen weniger gut bezahlten Berufen</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">can I say with respect to Eastern and Southern Africa that many of these points would apply there </s>    <s id="1:31">euh was euh Ost und Südafrika anbetrifft so möchte ich sagen dass vieles dort auch gilt</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">and I particularly would like to thank mister Caspary for working together with me</s>    <s id="1:32">ich möchte da vor allen Dingen Herr Caspary danken dass wir so gut zusammengearbeitet haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">and on the Pacific euh let me say the work of mister Audy</s>    <s id="1:33">euh zum Pazifischen Raum möchte ich sagen dass die Arbeiten von Herrn Audy auch sehr wichtig waren</s>
#
     <s id="1:34">but with respect to the ESA we need to look at good-governance issues in particular</s>    <s id="1:34">euh was aber diese Wirtschaftspartnerschaften anbetrifft so müssen wir uns auch um die Good Governance kümmern</s>
#
     <s id="1:35">this includes Zimbabwe </s>    <s id="1:35">das schließt auch Simbabwe mit ein</s>
#
     <s id="1:36">I don't have a problem with an interim agreement but I think a final agreement would be difficult for parliament to accept unless there was a clear road map in euh in the case of Zimbabwe to see an establishment of euh euh euh if you want euh a properly democratic euh regime there euh and one that could find it some way out of the difficulties it is in at the moment</s>    <s id="1:36">ich habe kein Problem mit einem Interimabkommen aber ich denke ein endgültiges wäre für das Parlament sehr schwierig zu akzeptieren wenn's nicht eine klare Roadmap gibt für Simbabwe damit da wirklich auch euh eine wirklich demokratisches Regime eingerichtet wird ein Regime was es wirklich möglich macht aus den Schwierigkeiten herauszukommen die man derzeit hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:37">euh the last point I'd like to make in relation to ESA apart from to endorse the report with some of the amendments that have been tabled of mister Caspary is to mention the situation of the Chagos Archipelago</s>    <s id="1:37">und noch ein letzter Punkt den ich im Zusammenhang mit den WPAs machen möchte abgesehen davon dass ich den Bericht unterstütze einige Änderungsanträge sind noch von Herrn Caspary dazu eingegangen also ich möchte noch die Situation des euh euh euh Archipels euh ansprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:38">euh it's in there because I tabled an amendment which was accepted</s>    <s id="1:38">euh dazu wurden Änderungsanträge hum eingereicht euh</s>
#
     <s id="1:39">euh we normally in these kind of agreements actually consult with neighbouring countries and neighbouring territories</s>    <s id="1:39">wir konsultieren normalerweise ja auch die Nachbarsländer</s>
#
     <s id="1:40"> the Chagos Archipelago is in the middle of this euh of part of this region: the Seychelles-Mauritius-Madagascar </s>    <s id="1:40">euh der Archipel euh liegt in der Mitte dieser Region euh Mauritius euh Madagaskar</s>
#
     <s id="1:41">euh these people are currently refugees in the Seychelles Islands</s>    <s id="1:41">die Menschen dort euh im Chagos-Archipel sind derzeit dort Flüchtlinge in euh den euh auf den nahe gelegenen Inseln</s>
#
     <s id="1:42">and I hope that we will consult with them between now and any final agreement being made as to what impact might be on them and on their territory should they get the right to return</s>    <s id="1:42">und wir hoffen dass wir da Konsultationen durchführen können bevor das endgültige Abkommen abgeschlossen wird wie die Auswirkungen auf sie aussehen und auf ihr Territorium wenn sie das Recht auf Rückkehr erhalten sollten</s>

     <s id="1:1">thanks very much President</s>    <s id="1:1">vielen Dank Herr Präsident</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">firstly let me say I think this has been a very good debate </s>    <s id="1:2">ich möchte zunächst mal vorwegschicken dass die Aussprache sehr positiv verlaufen ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">and we've had very positive contributions from both the Council and the euh Commission </s>    <s id="1:3">wir hatten sowohl vom Rat wie auch von der Kommission gute Beiträge gehört</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">I want to particularly pick up on expression the Council used when it said that the CARIFORUM is an example but not a template for other EPAs and I absolutely agree with that</s>    <s id="1:4">und ich möchte gern auf eine Formulierung eingehen die der Rat gewählt hat CARIFORUM ist ein Beispiel aber nicht das Modell für die euh anderen</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">it could be the basis for others</s>    <s id="1:5">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">NONE</s>    <s id="1:6">euh das soll keine Schablone sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">but euh each EPA has to have its own individuality</s>    <s id="1:7">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and we have to learn the lessons from the CARIFORUM negotiations as well </s>    <s id="1:8">also ich denke wir müssen Lehren ziehen aus den Verhandlungen mit CARIFORUM</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and secondly I was delighted that the Council  were able to make a commitment in relation to aid for trade and the member states intend to deliver on aid for trade</s>    <s id="1:9">und dann möchte ich auch gleichzeitig noch euh sagen dass ich mich freue dass der Rat Verpflichtungen eingegangen ist Aid for Trade</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">I was pleased that both Council and Commission reassured me on access to medicines</s>    <s id="1:10">also sowohl der Rat wie die Kommission haben mir gesagt dass der Zugang zum euh Medikamenten gewährleistet wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and that both Council and Commission reassured us that in terms of the five-year review</s>    <s id="1:11">und beide haben auch gesagt dass sie sich halten an eine echte Remission nach fünf Jahren</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">it will be a real review looking at the development objectives to make sure that they are being met</s>    <s id="1:12">wo man sich auch die Ziele nochmal anschaut und gewährleistet dass die Ziele eingehalten werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">I was delighted that the Commission said that she believed the regulation had to be in place before any liberalization and opening-up of financial services</s>    <s id="1:13">ich freue mich dass die Kommissarin gesagt hat dass sie davon überzeugt ist dass die Verordnung in Kraft treten muss bevor erst mal die Verordnung zu Finanzdiensteliestung in Kraft tritt</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">I think for some of us in this chamber that is also euh extremely important</s>    <s id="1:14">ich glaube das ist wirklich für uns von Bedeutung</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">she indicated as I think we knew but it is important again to have it on record that nothing in these agreements forced privatization of services in any of the Caribbean countries euh and that there's no expectation through this agreement that privatization of public services will take place</s>    <s id="1:15">euh sie hat gesagt dass in diesen Abkommen nichts die Privatisierung von Dienstleistungen erfordert und dass da auch keine Erwartungen an Privatisierungen an diese Abkommen geknüpft sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and I was pleased that she also made the commitments on the most-favoured-nation euh status</s>    <s id="1:16">und sie hat sich auch euh an den Grundsatz der Meistbegünstigungsklausel euh verpflichtet</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">on the basis that both what the Commission've said and what the Council've said are now on the record in this house as rapporteur I would be delighted to recommend to the house that we should give assent to the Caribbean EPA</s>    <s id="1:17">und euh ich als Berichterstatter würde mich freuen wenn wir die karibischen EPAs verabschieden könnten</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">let me turn to one separate issue which is the resolution</s>    <s id="1:18">jetzt möchte ich aber noch ein eigenes Thema ansprechen die Entschließung</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">a couple of my conservative EPP colleagues have made comments about this</s>    <s id="1:19">einige meiner EVP-Kollegen haben sich dazu geäußert</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">for the Socialists that are still red lines in terms of the current euh state of the resolution which is different from the assent vote</s>    <s id="1:20">aber bei euh für die Sozialisten gibt es da immer noch rote Linien</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">NONE</s>    <s id="1:21">das ist jetzt schwierig euh mit einzubeziehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">NONE</s>    <s id="1:22">also ich mein einige haben sich doch da miteinbezogen</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">euh actually all the things that the Council and Commission have committed themselves to are our red lines</s>    <s id="1:23">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:24"> so if the house are supporting the Council and the Commission I see no reason why they shouldn't support our compromises and compromise text and get those into the Parliament resolution</s>    <s id="1:24">und wenn die Kommission und der Rat das alles unterstützen können dann weiß ich nicht warum hier nicht der Kompromiss auch unterstützt werden könnte und warum man das nicht in eine Parlamentsentschließung münden lassen könnte</s>
#
     <s id="1:25"> and I hope at the end of the day we can vote both for assent and for a consensual resolution that is both opening up the trade but makeing very strong development euh commitments</s>    <s id="1:25">ich hoffe dass wir letztendlich zu einem Konsens kommen mit dem Handel geöffnet wird und wo dann auch Verpflichtungen für eine nachdrückliche Entwicklungsarbeit inbegriffen sind</s>

#
     <s id="1:7">yet the critics I find often tend to stop short they don't tend to actually look at what the European Union is doing to try and improve upon the existing situation and to put benefits into practice</s>    <s id="1:7">aber es wird euh eben nicht angesehen was die Europäische Union wirklich versucht zu tun um die Situation zu verbessern damit hier auch der Nutzen in die Praxis umgesetzt wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">they assume we are always static</s>    <s id="1:8">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">so here we have a piece of legislation that in practice has ensured that existing arrangements are simplified that red tape is cut that the legislation is clarified for all</s>    <s id="1:9">und hier ist es nun so dass wir Gesetzgebungen haben die in der Praxis sichergestellt hat dass bestehende Vorkehrungen vereinfacht euh worden sind weniger Bürokratie und die Gesetzgebung ist wirklich klarer</s>

     <s id="1:10">and we have a directive turned into a regulation</s>    <s id="1:10">wir haben eine Richtlinie die eine Verordnung umgewandelt worden ist</s>

     <s id="1:11">now back in my country that's terrible </s>    <s id="1:11">ja also in meinem Land ist das etwas fürchterliches</s>

     <s id="1:12">I mean that takes away a bit of freedom for manoeuvre for member states </s>    <s id="1:12">denn das nimmt euh Handlungsspielraum weg für die Mitgliedsstaaten</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but the reality is as we've seen with REACH as we now see with this industry does not want twenty seven different interpretations of a European rule</s>    <s id="1:13">aber die Realität ist eben wie wir's bei REACH gesehen haben und jetzt dass die Industrie eben nicht siebnundzwanzig verschiedene Auslegungen europäischer Regeln will</s>

     <s id="1:14">it wants the facility of knowing exactly where it stands across this market that we have the greatest market of its kind in the world </s>    <s id="1:14">sondern die Industrie will wissen wo sie steht und das auch bei diesem Markt das ist der größte Markt seiner Art weltweit</s>

     <s id="1:16">we are interdependent on each other in the challenges that attack us but also in the solutions which we can arrive at </s>    <s id="1:16">sondern wir sind voneinander abhängig bei den Herausforderungen vor denen wir stehen aber auch bei den Lösungen die wir finden können</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and I think that when we most need to chart this new way forward</s>    <s id="1:17">wir müssen diesen neuen Weg zusammen gehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">of course we can speak about the carbon-neutral economy the jobs created from that very important retraining and reskilling of course vitally important social protection for those most in need a necessity for development</s>    <s id="1:18">natürlich können wir hier über die Arbeitsplätze sprechen die hier geschaffen werden Schulungen euh euh Umschulungen Ausbildung Schutz euh der Bedürftigsten euh der Notwendigkeit euh zur Entwicklung</s>

     <s id="1:19">but let's not be hung up on saying how much money a banker will get is the determining factor of what kind of a solution we come up with</s>    <s id="1:19">aber wir dürfen uns nicht daran aufhängen und euh nur darüber sprechen euh wie viel Geld euh eine Bank euh erhält euh das euh ist euh der entscheidende Faktor</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">better regulation better supervision but also better enforcement of those regulations</s>    <s id="1:20">wir brauchen eine bessere Regulierung eine bessere Aufsicht euh aber auch eine bessere Durchsetzung der Regeln</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">because in a lot of cases with regard to the banking crisis it wasn't a lack of regulation but rather a lack of supervision and enforcement of the rules </s>    <s id="1:21">denn bei der Bankenkrise ging es ja nicht um eine fehlende Regulierung sondern fehlende Aufsicht euh und fehlende Durchsetzung der Regeln</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">and I think one of the key elements that we now have to look for and chart out for the future is instilling not just the certainty with regard to how the markets will operate the kind of shelters that would be got rid of the elimination of tax havens and shadow banking</s>    <s id="1:22">und darum geht es denke ich und das sollten wir in Zukunft beachten es geht nicht darum Sicherheit zu haben wie die Märkte funktionieren werden euh und euh hier die Steuerparadiese auszumerzen</s>

     <s id="1:21">it's that you're carrying on wilfully worsening our situation wantonly spending what little we have left</s>    <s id="1:21">aber Sie verschlimmern die Situation noch und euh geben die letzten Pfund noch aus die wir noch haben</s>

     <s id="1:24">Prime Minister you cannot carry on forever squeezing the productive bit of the economy in order to fund an unprecedented engorgement of the unproductive bit</s>    <s id="1:24">also Sie können die Produktivkräfte nicht weiter schrumpfen lassen und gleichzeitig euh den unproduktiven Teil immer weiter aufblähen</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">you cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way out of debt</s>    <s id="1:25">also Sie können nicht einfach sich aus der Krise herauskaufen und sich bis über den Hals verschulden</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">and when you repeat in that wooden and perfunctory way that our situation is better than others that we're well placed to weather the storm I have to tell you you sound like a Brezhnev-era Apparatchik giving the party line</s>    <s id="1:26">also wenn Sie sagen Briten stünde besser da als andere Länder also da klingen Sie nicht gerade überzeugend euh sondern eher wie ein Parteifunktionär</s>

     <s id="1:30"> they can see what the markets have already seen that you are the devalued Prime Minister of a devalued government</s>    <s id="1:30">und die werden dann auch einsehen was die Märkte schon festegestellt haben Sie sind ein wertgeminderter Premierminister</s>

#
     <s id="1:3">hum think this is a very important report that we have in front of us given the fact that our rapporteur Francisco Millán Mon has been able to bring this report from Foreign Affairs almost unanimously </s>    <s id="1:3">denke hm es geht heute um einen sehr wichtigen Bericht denn der Berichterstatter Francisco Millán Mon war in der Lage diesen Bericht euh euh wirklich im Außenauschuss fast einhellig verabschieden zu lassen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">I've not known that in the past where all groups have actually combined together to show that they're in favour of a stronger transatlantic partnership</s>    <s id="1:4">das gibt's kaum in der Vergangenheit dass wirklich fast alle Fraktionen gemeinsam gezeigt haben dass sie für eine stärkere transatlantische Partnerschaft sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and indeed in this report for the first time that I've noted in these debates we now call it the most strategic partnership that we have</s>    <s id="1:5">und zum ersten Mal euh stelle ich jetzt hier doch auch in der Debatte fest dass wir davon sprechen dass das die strategischste Partnerschaft ist die wir haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">we have lots of other ones but this one is the key one for us in the European Union</s>    <s id="1:6">es gibt viele andere aber das ist die Schlüsselpartnerschaft für uns in der EU</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">the reason's been mentioned a bit earlier </s>    <s id="1:7">es ist vorhin schon angesprochen worden</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">new tone under way</s>    <s id="1:8">es gibt jetzt auch neue Töne</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">but I sense too that this is a tone from the Americans looking to what Europe can do to be a partner in the global system</s>    <s id="1:9">und ich habe jetzt das Gefühl dass die Amerikaner neue Töne anschlagen und schauen wollen was können die Europäer tun um ein Partner im globalen System zu sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and then we have to think what we're going to be able to contribute to this process</s>    <s id="1:10">und wir müssen uns fragen was können wir dazu beitragen</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">I think that the highlight in this debate was you euh madam Commissioner saying that what we're  looking for is a more strategic dialogue</s>    <s id="1:11">ich denke in der Debatte euh war ein ganz wichtiger Aspekt Sie Frau Kommissarin als Sie sagten wir suchen nach einem strategischen Dialog</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">the ability to be able to look at long-term trends like the NIC report twenty twenty five to be able to look further down the road to see that we can share a common analysis together to be able to come to common action together </s>    <s id="1:12">wir wollen Fähigkeiten entwickeln langfristige Trends euh zu hum begleiten wie zwanzigfünfundzwanzig wir wollen ne gemeinsame Analyse entwickeln um auch gemeinsame Schritte einleiten zu können als Ergebnis der Analyse</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">this will need I suspect some generation within the European Union perhaps our support in the budget twenty ten to be able to formulate our own long-term thinking 'cause there's very little long-term thinking either in the Commission or indeed even in our house about long-term trends as the NIC report has done </s>    <s id="1:13">ich nehme mal an dass euh braucht euh auch Unterstützung euh hier in der EU auch im Bezug auf den Haushalt nächstes Jahr gut das ist ja auch nicht so langfristig und es gibt noch nicht viel langfristiges Nachdenken in der Kommission oder auch hier im Haus im Bezug auf langfristige Trends wie zum Beispiel NIC-Bericht</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">but in doing so this is my last point I think that we're gonna have to find a way where there's a more even playing field for involvement of Europeans and Americans in these debates </s>    <s id="1:14">aber ich komme zum letzten Punkt ich denke wir müssen Mittel und Wege finden gleichere Spielregeln zu entwickeln für das Einbeziehen der Amerikaner und der Europäer in diese Debatte</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">in the past five years we've seen a huge influx of US think tanks into Brussels telling us what we should be doing on particular aspects of policy</s>    <s id="1:15">in den letzten fünf Jahren haben wir gesehen dass ganz viele Think-Tanks aus den USA nach Brüssel kamen uns erzählten was wir tun sollten in bestimmten politischen Feldern</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and there's very little about Europeans being able in Washington for us to be able to communicate what our ideas are on the shaping of European policy </s>    <s id="1:16">aber ganz wenig tut sich da für Europäer in Washington  damit wir auch dort mitteilen können wie wir uns euh die Gestaltung der Politik vorstellen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">we need to focus on that to provide the right budgetary input to give that kind of impact so that we get an even input and feed-in into our transatlantic discussions          </s>    <s id="1:17">und da müssen wir auch was tun wir brauchen die entsprechenden Haushaltsmittel um solche Auswirkungen tätigen zu können wir brauchen Input und das muss einfließen in die transatlantischen Diskussionen</s>

     <s id="1:2">thank you very much Commissioner </s>    <s id="1:2">Frau Kommissarin vielen Dank</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">you've heard some diverging views around the house this morning on this euh issue</s>    <s id="1:3">Sie haben unterschiedliche Auffassungen gehört heute Morgen zu diesem Thema</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">I congratulate of course mister Siekierski</s>    <s id="1:4">ich gratuliere natürlich Herrn Siekierski</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and at a time of deepening economic recession and the tens of millions of people who are living in poverty who are hungry of course as a Parliament we have to find ways of euh helping them and providing them with food aid</s>    <s id="1:5">euh vor allem in Zeiten tiefgreifender Rezession in denen dutzende von Millionen in Armut euh leben und Hunger leiden als Parlament müssen wir natürlich Möglichkeiten finden diesen Menschen zu helfen sie mit Nahrungsmittel zu verosrgen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">but as the Commissioner pointed out there are nineteen participating member states in this project </s>    <s id="1:6">aber die Frau Kommissarin hat's ja gesagt es gibt neunzehn Mitgliedsstaaten die an diesem Projekt teilnehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">that means there are eight member states not participating</s>    <s id="1:7">das bedeudet acht Mitgliedsstaaten machen nicht mit</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">the UK is one of them</s>    <s id="1:8">und das Vereinigte Königreich gehört dazu</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and the reason is they use their own social policy to provide aid for the poor</s>    <s id="1:9">der Grund ist dass wir unsere Sozialpolitik einsetzen um den Armen zu helfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">they withdrew from this scheme many years ago </s>    <s id="1:10">wir sind vor Jahren aus dem System ausgestiegen</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">the question that many member states and the Commission are asking why are we using the CAP to finance social policy</s>    <s id="1:11">die Frage die viele stellen ist warum verwenden wir GAP um Sozialpolitik zu finanzieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">this used to be perfectly ok when we had massive surpluses when we had milk lakes butter mountains beef mountains and were required to distribute this euh euh food to the poor using euh the CAP budget to finance that distribution</s>    <s id="1:12">das war in Ordnung als wir unglaubliche Überschüsse hatten euh diese Butterberge diese Rindfleischberge diese Milchseen und als wir diese Überschüsse verteilen mussten an die Armen unter Zuhilfenahme des Haushalts euh der GAP damit haben wir das damals finanziert</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but now when there's very little in intervention and we are hearing now that we have to buy in food even from outwith the EU and use the CAP budget to distribute this food to store it</s>    <s id="1:13">jetzt gibt es aber nur wenig Interventionen und euh es heißt jetzt wir müssen Nahrungsmittel aufkaufen sogar innerhalb der EU und wir müssen euh den GAP-Haushalt euh nutzen um diese Nahrungsmittel dann zu verteilen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">this surely is becoming euh something that should be better handled by member states'  social policy </s>    <s id="1:14">also das müsste wirklich besser gehandhabt werden vor allem im Rahmen der Sozialpolitik der Mitgliedsstaaten</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">now when you consider that there are people living in complete deprivation in some of the new member states like Romania and many of these people by the way are subsistence farmers they are the people who are the poorest </s>    <s id="1:15">wenn man sich jetzt überlegt dass es Menschen gibt euh die in absoluter Armut in den neuen Mitgliedsstaaten in Rumänien zum Beispiel und viele dieser Menschen sind Landwirte die Selbstversorger sind die gehören gerade zu den Ärmsten</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">yet we are potentially taking money from them money from the CAP budget that could help them to distribute this food aid</s>    <s id="1:16">jetzt nehmen wir aber Geld euh aus dem GAP-Haushalt weg euh obwohl das Geld eigentlich diesen Leuten zu Gute kommen müsste</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">the main beneficiaries of whom are actually old member states like France Italy and Spain who seem to bethe main euh beneficiaries from this scheme </s>    <s id="1:17">die Hauptempfänger euh dieser Nahrungsmittelhilfe sind alte Mitgliedsstaaten Frankreich Italien und Spanien zum Beispiel  die euh profitieren am meisten von diesem System</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">so there has not been a level playing field applied to this distribution of aid </s>    <s id="1:18">von daher gibt es ja überhaupt keine Chancengleichheit bei dieser Nahrungsmittelhilfe</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and in future I think we should euh be very cautious about how we take this forward</s>    <s id="1:19">und in der Zukunft sollten wir sehr vorsichtig sein wenn wir uns an solche Programme wagen</s>

     <s id="1:5">hum as far as the collective redress proposal is concerned I think you are approaching it in exactly the right way </s>    <s id="1:5">was jetzt den Vorschlag zu kollektiven Rechtsdurchsetzungsverfahren betrifft so haben Sie den richtigen Weg eingeschlagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">hum we have consistently said that this is an extremely complex issue</s>    <s id="1:6">es ist ein sehr kompliziertes Thema</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">euh it involves euh not just European-level measures but also hum euh very difficult issues about engagement with national euh law and indeed regional law as well</s>    <s id="1:7">da sind jetzt nicht nur europäische Maßnahmen miteinzubeziehen sondern das ist euh ganz schwierig weil man sich zum Beispiel auch mit einzelstaatlichen und regionalen Rechtssetzungsfragen auseinandersetzen muss</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and above all I think as you indicated euh the consumer has to be at the heart of it </s>    <s id="1:8">und euh Sie haben auch gesagt dass der Verbraucher vor allem ganz im Zentrum der Frage stehen muss</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and you have been really consistent hum in saying that consumer confidence in the internal market and cross-border trading is one of the fundamental issues that we have to raise</s>    <s id="1:9">und da haben Sie auch die ganze Zeit konsequent gehandelt indem Sie gesagt haben das Vertrauen des Verbrauchers im Binnenmarkt ist ganz wichtig das ist ein Thema das wir immer wieder ansprechen müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">euh because otherwise consumers are not getting euh their rights of access and being able to use euh euh and exercise their choice across borders</s>    <s id="1:10">denn die Verbraucher bekommen sonst nicht das Recht Zugang zum Recht zu haben und können auch nicht grenzüberschreitend euh Wahlen treffen</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">euh and I think that remains at the heart of euh what you're discussing today</s>    <s id="1:11">das steht jetzt im Herzen unserer heutigen Diskussion</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">hum and above all I think the timing and complexity of solutions is important euh because you've evoked a wide range of solutions here</s>    <s id="1:12">euh so wie das getimet ist euh ist es eine wichtige Frage</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but it's quite clear that euh solutions that may involve euh some new European-level judicial mechanisms  will clearly take far longer and potentially be more controversial than picking up some of the alternative dispute resolution measures or also hum using the existing consumer cooperation measures that have been put in place</s>    <s id="1:13">also es ist angemessen dass man nach Lösungen sucht die euh zum Teil auf europäischer Ebene neue Rechtstraditionen bedeuten werden und das wird natürlich länger dauern und wird  umstritten sein wenn man da jetzt alternative Rechtsschlichtungsverfahren miteinbezieht euh euh dann kann man auch sehen dass man da Rechtsdurchsetzungsverfahren berücksichtigen muss die schon zum Teil gelten</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and I think all of us on this committee recall that in fact euh the enhanced cooperation on consumers was euh an aspect that was put through our committee in the last Parliament</s>    <s id="1:14">eine verstärkte Zusammenarbeit in Verbraucherfragen wurde ja bei der letzten Mandatsperdiode unseres Parlamentes vorgeschlagen</s>

     <s id="1:15">euh and we would like to see that become more effective</s>    <s id="1:15">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">NONE</s>    <s id="1:16">und ich möchte dass das jetzt stärker umgesetzt wird</s>

     <s id="1:17">and I think there is a vehicle there that can be used to give consumers the sort of redress that we are looking for not just in collective claims but also in dealing with cross-border claims themselves much more effectively </s>    <s id="1:17">das ist jetzt hier ein Mittel den Verbrauchern euh Rechtsdurchsetzungsmaßnahmen an die Hand zu geben die sie effizienter machen auch grenzüberschreitend</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and I think if we can get that sense of priority there and timing and speed euh to come up with the best solutions quickly I think that that is the way that I commend you to think about moving forward    </s>    <s id="1:18">und wenn wir zeigen können dass das eine Priorität für uns ist und dass wir jetzt versuchen möglichst rasch bestmögliche Lösungen zu finden dann ist das eine gute Vorgehensweise die ich hier nur empfehlen kann</s>

     <s id="1:2">and I'm very pleased indeed to have this opportunity to discuss this debate</s>    <s id="1:2">ja und ich freue mich dass wir jetzt über dieses Thema sprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">and it's only unfortunate that we're doing it on a Thursday afternoon when it's not quite as well attended as perhaps it should be </s>    <s id="1:3">und euh es ist leider euh nur schade dass das am Donnerstagnachmittag geschieht da sind natürlich nicht so viele Abgeordnete anwesend wie das vielleicht euh wünschenswert wäre</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">and because I do think this is an important debate</s>    <s id="1:4">ich halte die Diskussion für ganz wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and it's an important debate in the context of the current economic climate because we've already heard discussion about culture and about jobs and about how culture industries and people working in culture can contribute to the economy and can really help</s>    <s id="1:5">wichtig gerade in unserem Wirtschaftsklima wir haben doch schon gehört wie es aussieht mit der Kultur und Arbeitsstellen und wie die Kulturindustrie und die Menschen die im Kulturbereich beschäftigt sind einen Beitrag für die Wirtschaft leisten können</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and at the precarious times we are facing now which we've heard already in this Parliament it's important that we do discuss these matters as fully as we can</s>    <s id="1:6">in den schwierigen Zeiten in denen wir im Moment leben ist es wichtig und das haben wir hier im Parlament auch schon gehört dass wir über solche Fragen möglichst umfassend diskutieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and I am here also because I do actually represent one of those big cities that the previous speaker mentioned </s>    <s id="1:7">ich stehe jetzt hier weil ich selbst nämlich persönlich Vertreterin einer der größeren Städte bin die vom Vorredner erwähnt wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">I mean London as you all know is one of the cultural centres of the EU and with as we all have hum enormous history and very much to offer and also the centre of certainly the British cultural industries</s>    <s id="1:8">Sie wissen dass London eines der kulturellen Zentren der EU darstellt bei uns gibt es ein euh riesiges euh geschichtliches Erbe  wir haben viel anzubieten und euh das ist auch sicher das Zentrum der britischen Kulturindustrie</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">so I have a role here I think to speak for the people that I represent and to try to fight for those jobs which when things get bad are very often the first jobs to go</s>    <s id="1:9">also insofern euh denk ich kann ich für die Leute sprechen die mich euh die ich vertrete und kann mich schlagen für die Arbeitsstellen die ja häufig wenn die Wirtschaftslage schlechter wird euh als erstes in Schwierigkeiten gerät</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">so I very much welcome what the Commission has said about the role of cultural industries about how we want to preserve and to build on those and how there is an economic role for culture because I do feel that very often that economic role is ignored and we don't talk about it</s>    <s id="1:10">also die Rolle der Kulturindustrie euh ist hier im Zentrum wie wollen wir uns auf die Kultur stützen und wie wollen wir dafür sorgen dass die Kultur auch eine wirtschaftliche Rolle einnimmt ich hab häufig das Gefühl dass die wirtschaftliche Kultur ins Hintertreffen gerät</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">we don't even think about it</s>    <s id="1:11">wir denken ja noch nichtmal daran</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and we relegate culture to second-class status</s>    <s id="1:12">wir euh stufen die Kultur herab sie ist dann nur zweitrangig</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and really that's not acceptable and it's not acceptable now particularly when culture can be so very very important in our national and in our regional development</s>    <s id="1:13">aber das kann ich nicht mehr akzeptieren vor allem zu einem Zeitpunkt wo Kultur eine so 'ne wichtige Bedeutung in der euh einzelstaatlichen und regionalen Entwicklung einnehmen kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">so I do hope that one of the things that comes out from this debate today that we take back to our member states and the Commission and the Council take back that we are very very concerned about how this regional development happens how we deal with this and the role that culture can play in that</s>    <s id="1:14">ich würde mir wünschen dass aus der heutigen Diskussion unser Wunsch mitgenommen wird der sich an euh die Mitgliedsstaaten richtet und der auch an den Rat und die Komission sich richtet dass uns etwas daran liegt wie die Kultur weiterentwickelt wird und dass uns viel an der Rolle liegt die die Kultur kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and also of course as misses Pack has already talked about there is the whole question of cultural diversity </s>    <s id="1:15">Frau Pack hat es auch schon angesprochen es geht hier um kulturelle Vielfalt</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and I think one of the great strengths of the EU and of the European Parliament is that we all come together from you know now with twenty seven member states actually very different I think in many ways different backgrounds different cultures different way in now obviously different languages hum and that's just that we're starting</s>    <s id="1:16">und ich glaube eine der großen Stärken der EU und des Europäischen Parlamentes liegt doch genau darin dass wir hier aus siebenundzwanzig Mitgliedsstaaten zusammenkommen wir sind sehr unterschiedlich haben unterschiedliche Hintergründe unterschiedliche kulturelle euh Hintergründe sprechen unterschiedliche Sprachen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">although the world is getting smaller although people come together more there are still these significant differences still</s>    <s id="1:17">und euh die Welt wird zwar kleiner aber es ist doch so dass die Menschen zwar häufiger zusammenkommen dass es da aber doch ganz erhebliche Unterschiede gibt</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and we should be celebrating them because those differences are at the very core of the things that we talk about</s>    <s id="1:18">daraus sollten wir ein Fest machen das sollten wir hervorheben</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">we all want to preserve our identities how we feel about ourselves</s>    <s id="1:19">wir möchten unsere Identität bewahren wollen wir selbst bleiben</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">and we need to do that</s>    <s id="1:20">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">NONE</s>    <s id="1:21">und das spielt hier auch in diesem Zusammenhang eine Rolle</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">and we also I think in this context need to take on board that we are getting people coming into our continent we are getting people from other parts of the world many of whom of now in second and third generations in some of our member states who come from different backgrounds again</s>    <s id="1:22">wir sollten berücksichtigen dass die Menschen auf unseren Kontinent kommen aus anderen Teilen der Welt viele der Menschen leben schon in zweiter oder dritter Generation in unseren Mitgliedsstaaten haben einen anderen Hintergrund</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">and we'd also I think need to take this on board that they come with their own culture tradition and languages although we integrate them and they learn our languages</s>    <s id="1:23">das sollten wir hier auch berücksichtigen sie kommen an mit ihren eigenen Kulturhintergründen mit ihrer eigenen Sprache selbst wenn sie sich bei uns integrieren und unsere Sprache lernen</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">you know they are still there with their own separate identities</s>    <s id="1:24">so haben sie trotzdem noch eine eigene Identität</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">and that's an issue which hasn't been mentioned in this debate which I think is an important one</s>    <s id="1:25">und das ist ein Thema das hier gar nicht in die Diskussion eingeflossen ist das ist aber auch von Bedeutung</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">and one that we I hope can integrate particularly when we talk about issues such as multilingualism which we've had good debates on</s>    <s id="1:26">ich überleg ob man das vielleicht auch noch mit hineinnehmen könnte gerade wenn es um Mehrsprachigkeit geht dazu haben wir gute hilfreiche Diskussionen geführt</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">and it's an extremely important issue and I think one we should perhaps give more prominence to than we have done but one which I think we need to do in the context of a Europe which is changing</s>    <s id="1:27">das ist auch ein wichtiges Thema dem wir vielleicht sogar noch mehr Raum einräumen sollten als es bisher der Fall war das ist aber ein Thema das wir im Zusammenhang eines sich verändernden Europas besprechen sollten</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">we need to preserve therefore our existing cultures and our existing diversity and actually absorb the new diversity hm which has come and which is continuing to come into our continent </s>    <s id="1:28">wir sollten unsere bestehenden Kulturen die Vielfalt bewahren sollten die neue Vielfalt aber gleichzeitig mit aufnehmen die kommt zu uns die kommt nach Europa wird auch in Zukunft nach Europa kommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">for all of these reasons I do welcome the support that we are giving to culture and to cultural industries support to small and medium size enterprises which I do think in the current economic climate are possibly going to be the backbone of what we will be looking at</s>    <s id="1:29">ich kann nur begrüßen dass wir der Kultur und der Kulturindustrie unsere Unterstützung zusichern auch gerade den kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen in diesem Bereich im jetzigen Wirtschaftsklima werden die das Rückgrat sein dessen was wir erreichen wollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">NONE</s>    <s id="1:30">wir brauchen euh eine Verknüpfung</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">if large corporations large enterprises are losing people making people redundant and laying people off it may well be up to the smaller outfits the SMEs to pick up this slack and to actually go out there and create employment for those who can work in this sector</s>    <s id="1:31">die großen Unternehmen verlieren das die entlassen Arbeitnehmer und das mag letztendlich dann die Aufgabe der kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen sein euh mit dieser Herausforderung zurecht zu werden und Stellen für Leute zu schaffen die in dem Bereich tätig werden könnten</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">so I hope you know we will all recognize just how important the role of culture is in our continent in our society and that we who have actually turned up for this debate will take the message back to our member states to the regions to the people we represent</s>    <s id="1:32">ich hoffe dass das bei uns allen auf Anerkennung stößt dass die Kultur ganz wichtig ist auf unserem Kontinent in unserer Gesellschaft und euh wir die wir hier stehen werden dann die Botschaft in unsere Mitgliedsstaaten in die Regionen zu unseren Wählern zurückbringen</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">and I know we've got a good message to say so let's go out there and spread the word    </s>    <s id="1:33">und das ist eine frohe Botschaft die wollen wir verbreiten</s>

     <s id="1:4">I remember euh that we sat together on article thirteen hearings all that time ago</s>    <s id="1:4">ich erinnere mich daran dass wir über Artikel dreizehn diskutiert haben bereits schon vor langer Zeit</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and now eventually we've got to the situation that we're debating an anti-discrimination directive a possibility at long last that we might push through anti-discrimination legislation on all grounds not covered disability age religion or belief and sexual orientation</s>    <s id="1:5">und jetzt kamen wir allmählich in die Situation dass wir über eine Antidiskriminierungsrichtlinie euh sprechen eine Möglichkeit die sehr lange gedauert hat jetzt haben wir die Möglichkeit diese Antidiskriminierungsgesetzgebung voranzubringen für alle Gründen die nicht abgedeckt waren wie Religion Weltanschauung Behinderung Alter oder sexuelle Ausrichtung</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">we've waited many years for this </s>    <s id="1:6">wir haben jahrelang darauf gewartet</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">let's just hope that we get that large majority</s>    <s id="1:7">und wir hoffen dass wir nun diese gewaltige Mehrheit erreichen werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">I've campaigned on disability and age for many many years but I was convinced euh quite some time ago that we couldn't leave anybody behind</s>    <s id="1:8">ich habe mich schon lange dafür eingesetzt für die Gleichberechtigung von Behinderten aber ich war bereits vor langer Zeit überzeugt dass wir niemanden zurücklassen dürfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">we couldn't just go forward with a disability directive and then an age directive because I thought sexual orientation and religion would be left behind</s>    <s id="1:9">wir können hier nicht nur die Behindertenrichtlinie voranbringen eine Altersrichtlinie anschließen da sonst sexuelle Ausrichtung und Religion zurückgelassen werden wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">that's why in the own-initiative report last year I asked for a single directive to cover all areas that were not yet covered </s>    <s id="1:10">aus diesem Grund habe ich in meinem Initiativbericht letztes Jahr um eine einheitliche Richtlinie gebeten die alle Bereiche umfasst die bis jetzt noch nicht umfasst sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and I am delighted euh that's happened</s>    <s id="1:11">und ich bin erfreut dass dies jetzt passiert ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">I am very pleased we got such a large majority in the Parliament for that initiative report</s>    <s id="1:12">und ich bin erfreut dass wir eine solche gewaltige Mehrheit hier im Parlament haben für diesen Initiativbericht</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and I know from the Commission and Council that was one of the reasons they thought it was safe to actually bring this forward</s>    <s id="1:13">und ich weiß auch von Kommission und vom Rat dass dies einer Gründe war warum sie der Meinung waren dass es sicher ist ein solches Thema voranzubringen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and that's why we've got together a very large majority tomorrow for this report </s>    <s id="1:14">und gerade aus diesem Grund haben wir morgen eine so große Mehrheit für diesen Bericht</s>

     <s id="1:15">can I also say a very great thank you to Commissioner Špidla </s>    <s id="1:15">lassen sie mich auch einen großen Dank an Herrn Špidla sagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">I've thanked him at other times but I wanted to thank him in the plenary because without his support and help on this I don't honestly believe that we would have this on the table at the moment </s>    <s id="1:16">ich habe ihm schon andere Mal gedankt aber ich möchte ihm nun wirklich hier im Plenum danken denn ohne seine Unterstützung und seine Hilfe glaube ich ehrlich gesagt nicht dass wir dies heute nun auf dem Tisch hätten</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">so a sincere thank you from a lot of us for pushing this forward</s>    <s id="1:17">also ein aufrichtiger Dank von vielen von uns dass Sie dieses Thema vorangebracht haben</s>

     <s id="1:1">mister President</s>    <s id="1:1">Herr Präsident</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">I will be voting against this report and this proposed directive for three reasons</s>    <s id="1:2">ich werde gegen diesen Bericht stimmen und gegen diesen Richtlinienvorschlag aus drei Gründen</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">first of all I dissent from the belief that the EU rather than national governments should be legislating on these issues believing every member state is best placed to decide if it needs to strengthen such legislation</s>    <s id="1:3">erstens weil ich abweiche von der Meinung dass die EU und nicht die nationalen Regierungen hier die Gesetzesvorschriften erlassen sollten jedes Mitgliedsland davon bin ich überzeugt jeder Mitgliedsstaat ist besser euh geeignet hier die rechtlichen Vorschriften zu erlassen oder zu verstärken</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">if ever there was a subsidiarity issue this should be it </s>    <s id="1:4">wenn es jemals eine Subsidaritätsfrage gegeben hat dann ist es gerade diese</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">my second reason is that the new offence of harassment has the alarming prospect of in fact curbing the rights in respect of freedom of speech and freedom of religion particularly for those who proclaim a Christian message</s>    <s id="1:5">dann zweitens die euh Belästigungsregeln das führt dazu dass dadurch auch die freie Meinungsäußerung und die freie euh Religionsausübung eingeschränkt werden können vor allem für diejnigen die sich für die christliche Botschaft einsetzen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">Christians preaching the gospel particularly in a public place to people from other faiths who take offence and who claim it as an assault on their dignity could be breaching this law</s>    <s id="1:6">denn Christen verkünden die frohe Botschaft gerade auch an öffentlichen Orten an Andere die der Meinung sind dass dies dann ein Verstoß gegen ihre Würde ist und damit könnte auch dies dann als Belästigung interpretiert werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">likewise defending and promoting a biblical approach to heterosexual marriage could allow litigious euh gay rights activists to claim harassment </s>    <s id="1:7">und auch der Einsatz für eine euh Förderung der heterosexuellen Ehe könnte von homosexuellen Aktivisten als Belästigung angeklagt werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and the third reason is that the measures within the directive are disproportionate and inadequately balanced it compels the Christian printer for example to accept an order to print material which offends his religious beliefs whereas he should be free to conduct his business according to his conscience</s>    <s id="1:8">drittens sind die euh Bestimmungen in diesem Vorschlag unverhältnismäßig und euh übermäßig zum Beispiel werden christliche Herausgeber hierdurch euh gezwungen Dinge zu drucken die gegen seine christliche Überzeugung verstoßen er sollte doch die euh das Recht haben nur das zu veröffentlichen was seinem Gewissen entspricht</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">without essential balancing mechanisms this directive will become an instrument which in fact creates discrimination</s>    <s id="1:9">ohne entsprechende Auslgeiche wird diese Richtlinie zu einem Instrument welches die Diskriminierung sogar noch verstärkt</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">thus to me it is an unnecessary directive infringing basic rights particularly of people of faith and conscience and illustrates all that is over-reaching meddling and wrong-headed within the EU</s>    <s id="1:10">deswegen ist diese Richtlinie für mich unnötig sie verstößt gegen Grundrechte vor allem die Grundrechte von Menschen die euh Glauben und Gewissen vertreten und es ist eine Richtlinie die sich einmischt in Angelegenheiten die die EU nichts angehen</s>

     <s id="1:4">most of the opposition I have heard to this this afternoon I think is sincerely euh felt and believed</s>    <s id="1:4">die meisten Einwände die ich heute Nachmittag gehört habe euh sind sicherlich aufrichtig euh</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">but it's not based on the facts and it's not based on the text before us</s>    <s id="1:5">aber man stützt sich dabei nicht auf Tatsachen und auch nicht auf den Text der uns vorliegt</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">nothing in this report undermines subsidiarity or proportionality</s>    <s id="1:6">nichts in diesem euh Bericht untergräbt ja die Subsidarität oder die Verhältnismäßigkeit</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and indeed if it did it would be corrected by the Council of Ministers</s>    <s id="1:7">und wenn das so wäre dann würde das Ganze im Ministerrat wieder korrigiert werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">so I urge you even now to vote in favour and allow the Council of Ministers to do the right thing to make sure that it is absolutely proportionate and subsidiarity is respected </s>    <s id="1:8">also ich möchte Sie sogar jetzt noch auffordern dafür zu stimmen damit der Ministerrat auch das Richtige unternehmen kann um sicherzustellen dass es wirklich euh der Verhältnismäßigkeit und der Subsidarität genügt</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">but you know mister Weber Europe actually was born out mister Weber Europe was born out of the values of the second world war</s>    <s id="1:9">Herr Weber Europa Herr Weber Europa beruht auf den Werten die entstanden sind euh nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">a determination that we would never look away again whilst one group of individuals or other groups were targeted or scapegoated and led away to concentration camps and work camps a determination that there would be no hierarchy of oppression</s>    <s id="1:10">und wir haben gesagt wir waren entschlossen dass wir so etwas nie wieder haben wollten euh keine Situation haben wollten bestimmte Gruppen von Menschen jetzt als Sündenböcke abgestempelt würden und in Arbeits und Konzentrationslagern weggeführt worden also wir hatten eine Entschlossenheit dass es einfach keine Hierarchie der Unterdrückung mehr geben sollte</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and yet sadly you want to have a Europe that is not based on those decent values a Europe that believes and respects that all human beings are born equal</s>    <s id="1:11">und jetzt bedauerlicherweise möchten Sie ein Europa haben dass sich nicht auf diese anständigen Werte stützt ein Europa das glaubt und respektiert dass alle Menschen gleich geboren werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and therefore you have to those opposed to this have to answer both to their conscience and to their religion and to their voters as to why you believe some people should be treated differently from others that they should not have equality</s>    <s id="1:12">und deshalb müssen diejenigen die gegen diesen Text sind zunächst einmal vor ihrem eigenen Gewissen und vor ihrer Religion sich eine Antwort geben sie müssen auch ihren Wählern gegenüber Rechenschaft ablegen und sagen weshalb sie der Auffassung sind dass einige Menschen anders behandelt werden sollten als andere dass es hier keine Gleichheit geben sollte</s>

#
     <s id="1:15">NONE</s>    <s id="1:15">und euh das ist euh tja dafür habe ich mich entschieden</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">but I stand here fighting for equality not just for gay men and lesbians and bisexuals and transgender people but people on the basis hm of their age their religion their belief their gender anything that is perceived to be different that could be used to take away from them equality</s>    <s id="1:16">und ich stehe hier und trete ein für Gleichheit nicht einfach nur für die Rechte von Homosexuellen und Lesben und Bisexuellen und euh anderen euh sondern auch für Menschen die euh eben euh euh vielleicht ein anderes Alter haben oder andere sexuelle Ausrichtung Geschlecht und so weiter also alles was man jetzt hier nehmen könnte um sie euh irgendwie zu diskriminieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and I believe the litmus test of any civilised society is not how we treat a majority which interestingly is made up of so many different minorities</s>    <s id="1:17">und ich denke der Lackmustest in einer Gesellschaft liegt nicht darin wie wir die Mehrheit euh behandeln die ja interessanterweise auch aus so vielen verschiedenen Minderheiten besteht</s>

     <s id="1:18">the litmus test of any civilised society as people listening in the visitors'gallery will tell you is not how we treat the majority but how we treat the minorities</s>    <s id="1:18">sondern der Lackmustest einer jeden zivilisierten Gesellschaft euh hum und das werden Ihnen auch die Besucher euh sagen besteht nicht darin wie wir die Mehrheit behandeln sondern wie wir die Minderheiten behandeln</s>

     <s id="1:6">and that's the way you have approached this in its entirety</s>    <s id="1:6">und so sah der ganze Ansatz aus dass euh euh euh fand alle euh Möglichkeiten hier gegeben sind</s>

#
     <s id="1:8">I only wish I could euh afford myself euh of that privilege but you've approached it in how we can make this work for the citizen and it's a brilliant example euh I think for the rest of euh the house</s>    <s id="1:8">euh Sie haben euh das euh wirklich in dieser Form sind das in dieser Form angegangen wie können wir die Arbeit für den Bürger erleichtern und das ist ein brillantes Vorbild glaube ich für dieses Haus</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">hum we often come at this where putting forward amendments which hm may improve the text and may have coherence</s>    <s id="1:9">es ist ja häufig so dass wir Änderungsanträge anbringen müssen die den Text verbessern und ihn kohärenter gestalten</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">but does it serve the citizen</s>    <s id="1:10">aber dient das dem Bürger</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and that has always been euh your approach </s>    <s id="1:11">aber das war immer Ihr Ziel und euh Ihr Bestreben</s>

     <s id="1:12">I'm pleased to say that we have the multiple-entry visas we've got also the whole issue of appeal which was there euh and I worked with it's awful to name a member of the DG</s>    <s id="1:12">wir haben jetzt euh die hm hm euh Mehrfachvisen und euh ich euh euh ich weiß jetzt nicht mehr wie der Vertreter der Generaldirektion heißt aber euh dort wurden wir auch unterstützt</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but I worked with Jan euh on this very important principle of if you're refused a visa or you're refused entry into the Schengen area it's not a suspensive appeal but the authority that refuses must make itself accountable</s>    <s id="1:13">wir haben mit Jan zusammengearbeitet und wenn man euh jetzt euh in den Schengenbereich nicht für den Schengenbereich kein Visa bekommt euh hm dann euh muss man dafür auch wirklich eine Begründung vorlegen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">so thank you once again and thank you to the Commission euh for making sure that we have that principle enshrined here</s>    <s id="1:14">also das ist gut dass wir jetzt diese euh Grundsätze geschaffen haben</s>

     <s id="1:1">thank you mister president</s>    <s id="1:1">ja schönen Dank Herr Präsident</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">hum like mister Tatarella I'd  like to begin by thanking the people closely involved with hum helping us reach first-reading agreement today on the EMAS report to the shadows who are here today the Commission who have been very helpful in getting agreement and to the Czech presidency who aren't here to hear my thanks and also to the staff in the Parliament and my own assistant and in the groups and my own assistant Elizabeth who played a big role in making sure we were here today because it all went very fast from this time we started discussing it to today</s>    <s id="1:2">wie Herr Tatarella möchte auch ich all denen herzlich danken die uns mitgeholfen bei der ersten Lesung ich danke den Schattenberichterstattern die heute hier sind ich danke Kommission die mitgeholfen hat euh bei einer Lösung und auch der tschechischen Präsidentschaft die jetzt euh grad noch nicht da ist und natürlich auch dem Personal im Parlament und meine eigenen Assistenten und denen in der Fraktion meine eigene Assistentin Elizabeth hat wirklich euh eine wichtige Rolle dabei gespielt dass wir so weit gekommen sind und heute hier sind denn es war ein langer Weg</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">so we now have agreement before the election</s>    <s id="1:3">es ist wichtig dass wir vor den Wahlen noch zu einer Regelung kommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">hum EMAS is a voluntary scheme which provides a framework to assist businesses and organisations to improve their environmental performance </s>    <s id="1:4">EMAS ist eine freiwillige Regelung als Rahmen für die Unternehmen und Organisationen um ihre Umweltperformanz zu verbessern</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">it started fourteen years ago and it's had some modest success with about four thousand participants</s>    <s id="1:5">vor vierzehn Jahren begann das System und hat euh etwa viertausend Teilnehmer als einen bescheidenen Erfolg</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">but if you think about that that's not such a huge number in the overall European Union</s>    <s id="1:6">naja das sind nicht sehr viele in der ganzen Union</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">now the Commission set a target of increasing that to thirty five thousand participants</s>    <s id="1:7">die Kommission hat ein Ziel für einen Erhöhung auf fünfunddreißigtausend Teilnehmer gesetzt</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">that's very ambitious target it's a ten fold increase almost</s>    <s id="1:8">das sind sehr ehrgeizig Ziel also eine Verzehnfachung fast</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and I think it's right that we should try and improve the take-up of EMAS because otherwise its impact is going to remain limited</s>    <s id="1:9">nun zurecht sollten wir in der Tat versuchen also die Aufnahme von EMAS zu verbessern denn sonst wird das begrenzte Wirkung haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">but if we are to increase the impact we also have to retain the environmental integrity of the program</s>    <s id="1:10">aber wenn jetzt die Wirkung verbessert werden soll müssen wir auch eben die Umweltrelevanz halten</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and I think the hum agreement we reached today does achieve that balance between hopefully making it more attractive to people while at the same time hum retaining the environmental integrity</s>    <s id="1:11">und die heutige Vereinbarung stellt dieses Gleichgewicht in ein gutes Licht dar und macht die Sache attraktiver für die Beteiligten und erhält die Umweltintegrität</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">we have made some changes  we've agreed with the Commission and I think they're important</s>    <s id="1:12">also wir haben noch ein paar Veränderungen da vereinbart mit der Kommission</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">corporate registration so that a company or organisation with more than one site can actually register once in one country </s>    <s id="1:13">also die Registrierung von Unternehmen also dass ne Organisation in einem Land sich registrieren kann also die in verschiedenen Ländern tätig ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">very important this Parliament had to register three times Luxembourg France and Belgium in order to get EMAS </s>    <s id="1:14">also hier im Parlament musste in Luxemburg Belgien und euh Frankreich sich euh registrieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and from what I hear from the staff it was not an easy thing to do so that kind of change is important</s>    <s id="1:15">und das Personal zeigt es war gar nicht einfach und also eine solche Veränderung ist wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">cluster registration for organisations involved in the same sector hum reduced fees and lighter reporting requirements for SMEs</s>    <s id="1:16">es gibt auch einen Clusterregistrierung für Organisationen die im gleichen Sektor tätig sind Verringerung der Gebühren und euh Erleichterung für KMUs bei der Berichterstattung</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">NONE</s>    <s id="1:17">das ist sehr wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">I think EMAS is a bit too burdensome for small organisations</s>    <s id="1:18">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">so it does need to change and better alignment with the ISO 14001</s>    <s id="1:19">dann eine bessere Anpassung an die ISO 14001</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">particularly important to me is the introduction of sectoral support documents</s>    <s id="1:20">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">I think the Commission is going to work very hard at this</s>    <s id="1:21">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:22"> and this will help organisations to benchmark themselves against their similar organisations and also the introduction of core indicators</s>    <s id="1:22">auch vor allem die Einführung von sektorspezifischen Referenzdokumenten erlaubt es den Organisationen sich eben im Vergleich zu stellen mit ähnlichen Organisationen und euh es wurden auch euh Eckdatenindikatoren eingeführt</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">these are very important to improve the program and hum and to help people on the outside look at organisations and see how they're doing</s>    <s id="1:23">damit eben die Leute draußen sich auch vergleichen können und sehen was die anderen leisten</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">I do hope these will encourage people to take part in EMAS</s>    <s id="1:24">das ermutigt sicherlich die Beteiligten also EMAS zu übernehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">not because I want to play a numbers game and see EMAS competing with ISO</s>    <s id="1:25">nicht weil wir jetzt einfach die Zahl aufblähen wollen und euh in Wettbewerb mit ISO treten wollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">but because I think the scheme is a good one</s>    <s id="1:26">aber ich halte das einfach für eine gute Maßnahme</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">and it could help us to meet our sustainability criteria</s>    <s id="1:27">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">NONE</s>    <s id="1:28">und euh vor allem diese Nachhaltigkeitskriterien sind wichtig</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">hum president today the eyes of the world are very much on London where world leaders are gathered to talk about the financial downturn and the global banking crisis </s>    <s id="1:29">Herr Präsident also heute guckt man vor allem nach London wo die Führer der Welt über die weltweite Bankenkrise und den Abschwung der Wirtschaft sprechen wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">and there'll be some no doubt who are wondering why we're sitting here talking about environmental auditing hum euh at a time when organisations and companies are feeling the financial strain</s>    <s id="1:30">und euh man kann sich vielleicht fragen wieso wir hier sitzen und über Umweltbetriebsprüfungen sprechen zu einem Zeitpunkt wo eben viele Organisationen finanzielle Zwänge haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">they'll see as a distraction this kind of initiative of the Commission</s>    <s id="1:31">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">but I think that is wrong</s>    <s id="1:32">aber ein solcher Zweifel ist falsch</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">for me and my Socialist colleagues the green agenda is very much part of the solution to emerging from the financial crisis that we're in</s>    <s id="1:33">also für mich und die sozialistischen Kollegen ist die grüne Agenda ein wesentlicher Teil der Lösung um aus der Finanzkrise herauszukommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:34">and we need to invest in energy in renewables</s>    <s id="1:34">wir brauchen Energieinvestitionen bei der erneuerbaren Energie</s>
#
     <s id="1:35">and we need to be cutting our environmental footprint </s>    <s id="1:35">wir müssen unsere Umweltbelastung und unseren Umweltfußabdruck verringern</s>
#
     <s id="1:36"> and so although EMAS is a very very modest program in all of that big scheme about climate change which the Commissioner has worked so hard on and I think it does play nevertheless a role in helping the European Union and the rest of the world to cut our environmental footprint </s>    <s id="1:36">EMAS ist zwar ein sehr begrenztes und bescheidenes Programm also im Vergleich zu dem Klimawandel und so weiter aber dennoch ist das ein wichtiger Schritt eine Rolle der Union im Umweltbereich zu spielen</s>

#
     <s id="1:2">can I hum support euh my colleague Linda McAvan and congratulate members of the Environment Committee for bringing forward this report</s>    <s id="1:2">ich meinerseits möchte meine Kollegin Linda McAvan beglückwünschen auch den Mitgliedern des Umweltausschusses möchte ich danken für diesen Bericht</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">but as Parliament's rapporteur on Corporate Social Responsibility I wanted to make a contribution in this debate</s>    <s id="1:3">ich als euh Berichterstatter  für Unternehmen und soziale Verantwortung möchte ich euh hier 'n Beitrag leisten zu diesen beiden Berichten</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">putting the debate about labelling ecolabelling and EMAS in terms of reporting by companies into the wider context of what we are trying to do on corporate responsibility and accountability</s>    <s id="1:4">EMAS unter Umweltzeichen im weiteren Kontext was wir erreichen wollen zur sozialen Verantwortung von Unternehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and in particular to deal with the issue about whether voluntary schemes as against statutory schemes are the right way forward and whether European-focused schemes is the right way forward or indeed a global approach</s>    <s id="1:5">insbesondere ob ein freiwilliges System euh im Vergleich zu einem obligatorischen System der richtige Weg sind und ob euh der eurpäische Ansatz der richtige Weg oder eine guter Ansatz ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">certainly the problem from a corporate responsibility point of view is that a proliferation of voluntary schemes euh can be more costly less clear euh can actually lead to competition that is wasteful for businesses for consumers indeed for all stakeholders</s>    <s id="1:6">natürlich ein Problem euh von euh Perspektive der Verantwortung der euh Unternehmen ist euh nun so dass Ausweitung solcher Systeme weniger kostspielig weniger klar ist es kann zu Wettbewerb führen was natürlich euh nicht gut ist für die Unternehmen für Verbraucher und für alle Beteiligten</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and of course there's a temptation for some companies to use the least onerous least costly but least effective tool</s>    <s id="1:7">und es ist natürlich eine Versuchung für manche Unternehmen das am wenigsten kostspieligste aber das am wenigsten euh effizienteste System zu nutzen euh freiwilliges System</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and the problem of voluntarism also may be that it is just not going to be enough</s>    <s id="1:8">das Problem ist auch dass es einfach nicht genug sein wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and particularly in terms of the climate change debate I was struck when the climate change bill went through the domestic parliament in my own member state the United Kingdom how the British Employers' Federation the CBI actually came out and said they wanted binding statutory reporting on climate change impact by business</s>    <s id="1:9">insbesondere innerhalb der Klimawandeldebatte hat es mich überrascht dass als euh es in meinem eigenen Land Großbritannien das Gesetz durchgegangen ist die Arbeitgeberverband euh gesagt hat ja sie wollten eigentlich euh verbindliches euh Audit-System für die Unternehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and given what we are saying in the European Union about what needs to happen on climate change euh even with the changes we're agreeing in this report will it be enough</s>    <s id="1:10">und jetzt euh euh ausgehend davon was wir in der Europäischen Union zum Klimawandel sagen auch euh da müssen wir uns die Frage stellen wird das genug sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and lastly the issue of global versus European four thousand companies in EMAS thirty five thousand in ISO 14001</s>    <s id="1:11">und hum ist nun so dass das ein europäisches System ist viertausend Unternehmen fünfunddreißig tausend in ISO 14001</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">is it because the ISO is less onerous or is it because our companies working in global not just European markets want a global approach </s>    <s id="1:12">ist das weil euh ISO weniger kostspielig ist oder ist es weil unser Unternehmen global sind und euh jetzt nicht nur europäisch</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and I invite the Commission not simply to promote and apply EMAS and I want it to be successful but also to look outward to establishing strengthening global initiatives on carbon emission reporting by companies and other aspects of corporate responsibility so that we get strong global mechanisms and that we then can apply and promote them on our own continent</s>    <s id="1:13">ich möchte die Kommission auffordern nicht nur EMAS euh zu hum unterstützen ich möchte dass das 'n Erfolg ist  sondern sie sollen sich auch anschauen wie man eine globale Initiative stärken kann zu CO2 hm Audit und auch zu anderen Aspekten der sozialen Verantwortung von Unternehmen sodass wir wirklich einen globalen Mechanismus haben einen starken sodass wir die auch für unseren eigenen Kontinent das unterstützen</s>

     <s id="1:11">amongst them is the issue of management of risk</s>    <s id="1:11">euh es geht hier richtig um Risikomanagement unter anderem</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and I think that it's not enough now that regulators simply tick boxes to establish whether or not euh the industry that they are meant to be guarding and protecting on behalf of the consumer is doing the right thing</s>    <s id="1:12">das reicht jetzt nicht dass die Regulierer einfach nur irgendwelche Kästchen ankreuzen um festzustellen ob die Branche euh die überwachen sollten und schützen sollten im Namen der Verbraucher ob die auch wirklich ordentlich arbeiten</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">it is essential that the day-to-day business euh of insurance and reinsurance companies are actually watched managed and monitored euh by regulators over a period of time</s>    <s id="1:13">es ist wichtig dass sie das tägliche Geschäft der euh Versicherungs und Rückversicherungsunternehmen wirklich beobachtet und überwacht werden von den Regulierern und dass das die ganze Zeit über gemacht wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">it is by this process and this process alone really that we will be able to establish a proper and appropriate form of regulation</s>    <s id="1:14">nur über diesen Prozess werden wir in der Lage eine ordentliche euh euh Verordnung zu schaffen</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">it is the reporting of companies yes they will be doing things to tell regulators what they're doing but regulators will have to be involved and across twenty seven member states not each individual member state with their own separate rules now considering what they can apply in terms of that regulation</s>    <s id="1:15">es geht hier natürlich um unsere die Berichterstattung der Unternehmen die müssen natürlich auch den Regulierern genau sagen was sie tun aber sie müssen sich auch selbst einbringen und dann haben wir natürlich siebenundzwanzig Mitgliedsstaaten also hier ist nicht euh jeder Mitgliedsstaat mit getrennten Vorschriften und dann können sie sich überlegen was sie anwenden können</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">but indeed they will be applying a standard formula of regulation across the European Union which will lead to frankly the better consumer platform of protection that we expect</s>    <s id="1:16">nein es wird jetzt eine Standardformel querbeet in der EU angewandt werden und sie wird euh wirklich zu einer besseren euh Verbraucherschutzplattform führen müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">similarly companies will manage to get economies of scale from this regulation</s>    <s id="1:17">euh die Unternehmen werden natürlich auch euh economies of scale euh erzielen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">because now they will be reporting only in one way to each of the regulators what they produce what they have to say what they do</s>    <s id="1:18">denn sie werden dann euh nur in eine Richtung jeden euh Regulierer euh Bericht erstatten darüber was sie tun</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and how they report will not just be to one regulator but could be to a college of regulators especially for groups because as insurance companies cross borders</s>    <s id="1:19">euh aber sie werden das jetzt quasi an den Kollegium von Regulierern machen und insbesondere was Gruppen betrifft denn diese euh Versicherungsunternehmen arbeiten ja grenzüberschreitend</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">of course it is now important that regulators team up and work together to ensure that the appropriate levels of reporting the appropriate levels of figures and what information are supplied are brought to bear to make sure that euh the markets are best protected</s>    <s id="1:20">da ist natürlich auch wichtig dass die Regulierer sich zusammentun und zusammenarbeiten um auch sicherzustellen dass die Berichterstattungsebene die richtige ist also auch die Zahlen stimmen und dass auch die Informationen euh so verteilt werden dass die Märkte am besten geschützt werden können</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">it was during the discussion of course with the Council that Parliament has seen some interesting and perhaps sometimes even euh deliberate ploys to move euh national industries one way or another</s>    <s id="1:21">während der Diskussionen mit dem Rat hatte das Parlament dann schon ein paar interessante manchmal auch vielleicht euh bewusste Tricks gesehen wo man versucht hatte nationale euh Industrie eine andere Richtung zu bringen</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">so I can't pretend that this hasn't been a very difficult dossier to try to negotiate with Council</s>    <s id="1:22">ich kann es nicht vorgeben dass das nicht schwierig gewesen ist bei den Diskussionen mit dem Rat</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">NONE</s>    <s id="1:23">es war wirklich schwierig</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">it has Parliament of course has pushed Council a long way</s>    <s id="1:24">das Parlament hat natürlich euh den Rat ziemlich weit euh bringen können</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">it pushed it further than I think Council established and really wanted to go under the last two presidencies</s>    <s id="1:25">und der Rat euh euh euh also ist jetzt weiter gegangen als bei den letzten zwei Ratsvorsitzern</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">so I'm very proud and pleased to have worked with the team that I have in order to be able to get Council to move</s>    <s id="1:26">also ich bin sehr erfreut über euh das Team mit dem ich zusammengearbeitet habe euh und den wir haben den Rat doch in eine gewisse Richtung bringen können</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">unfortunately we will not have the kind of group support euh that we initially envisaged that we should</s>    <s id="1:27">leider Gottes werden wir nicht die Gruppenunterstützung erleben die wir uns eigentlich ursprünglich vorgestellt hatten</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">but because we are able to insert a review clause in this directive we will be able to come back euh to group support hum after three years of the introduction of this particular directive I am hoping and I expect the Commissioner to tell me that he will anticipate doing this as well be able to bring back group support in one way or another specifically to match the economic side of this particular approach</s>    <s id="1:28">aber da wir eine Revisionsklausel in diese Richtlinie einbauen konnten werden wir diese Gruppenunterstützung nochmals ansehen und nach drei Jahren also nach Inkrafttreten dieser Richtlinie hoffe ich und erwarte auch vom Kommissar dass er mir sagen wird dass er das ebenfalls so sieht dass wir dann alle diese Gruppenunterstützung wieder hineinbringen können der ein oder andere Art und Weise um eben auch die ökonomische Seite dieses Ansatzes in den Griff bekommen zu können</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">we want a regulation that is risk-based and principle-based but one that will also support the capacity of the industry and one which will promote the very best instincts of regulators across the European Union and abroad</s>    <s id="1:29">wir wollen hier euh risiko- und euh grundsatzbasierte euh Regulierung aber etwas was auch die besten Instinkte der Regulierer in der EU fördert und auch außerhalb der EU</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">I will just finish on this one note</s>    <s id="1:30">möchte noch am Ende etwas sagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">we must also challenge regulators elsewhere in the world and recognize country-to-country regimes only</s>    <s id="1:31">wir müssen antürlich auch die Regulierer anderswo in der Welt herausfordern und wir müssen dann euh die gewissen Ordnungen von Land zu Land einzeln anerkennen</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">and I hope the Commissioner will agree with me about that</s>    <s id="1:32">ich hoffe die Kommission ist mit mir einer Meinung</s>

     <s id="1:2">I'd like to start off saying what perhaps I should've said first of all which is the thank you to all the services of the Commission the Council and particularly the Parliament for the work that they put into this which I have to say hum without their work without their help we wouldn't have achieved</s>    <s id="1:2">ich sag etwas was ich vielleicht früher schon hätte sagen sollen ich möchte mich bei allen Dienststellen im Kommission Rat und insbesondere im Parlament für deren Arbeit euh und Zuarbeit bedanken ich muss sagen ohne deren Arbeit ohne deren Hilfestellung hätten wir euh das alles nicht erreicht</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">like many around the room we're quite astounded by the level of technical detail that goes into euh many of these reports</s>    <s id="1:3">euh ich bin ja auch euh überrascht euh darüber wie viele technische Details viele dieser Berichte umfassen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">but let's say about Solvency II that it was forged outside of a crisis to face a crisis</s>    <s id="1:4">ich möchte zu Solvabilität II zumindest sagen dass das wirklich außerhalb der Krise geschmiedet wurde um eine Krise bewältigen zu können</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">it has risk management in it</s>    <s id="1:5">es gibt Risikomanagementelemente drin</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and as many people have heard round the room this is a first for much of the financial services legislation </s>    <s id="1:6">und viele haben es ja hier im Raum schon gehört das ist euh die erste Finanzdienstleistungsvorschrift diesbezüglich</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">it also does and I agree with the Commissioner contain group supervision</s>    <s id="1:7">und es geht hier euh natürlich auch um die Gruppenaufsicht</s>

     <s id="1:11">capital is defined as well</s>    <s id="1:11">Kapital wird auch definiert</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">many aspects of this report make it a world leader  </s>    <s id="1:12">und viele Aspekte dieses Berichts machen euh das ganze zu einem weltweiten Führer</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">but my second point is about the strategic impact of using such legislation</s>    <s id="1:13">aber das Wichtige ist die strategische Auswirkung der Verwendung derartiger Rechtsvorschriften</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">in many respects just having a regulation that works over twenty seven member states isn't gonna be helped if we don't have the twin which is a strategic regulator at a European level which works over twenty seven member states as well </s>    <s id="1:14">also viele euh erwarten ja euh dass dann eine euh Vorschrift die in siebenundzwanzig Staaten funktionieren sollte euh das die nichts bringt wenn wir nicht gleichzeitig auf europäische Ebene einen Zwilling haben der dann die Aufsicht ist das muss dann auch siebenundzwanzig mal funktionieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">we need to overcome the differences that exist between regulators and make sure that we speak with one voice</s>    <s id="1:15">wir müssen hier die Unterschiede zwischen Regulierern überbrücken und wir müssen sicherstellen dass wir mit einer Stimme sprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">it's particularly important when we come to recognize regimes elsewhere in the world</s>    <s id="1:16">insbesondere ist das wichtig wenn wir dann euh Regimes andersow in der Welt anerkennen sollen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and I met with Paul Kanjorski chair of the Subcommittee on Finance in the US Congress just this weekend and others who are now talking about accelerating the prospects for a single regulator at a federal level euh in the United States </s>    <s id="1:17">ich habe mich mit Paul Kanjorski getroffen der ist Vorsitzender des euh Unterausschusses für Finanzen im US-Kongress und euh auch mit anderen die reden jetzt davon dass man die Aussichten für eine einzige euh also die Aussicht auf einen einzige Regulierung in den USA zu beschleunigen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">if they do that before we do we could be severely embarrassed by not having the regulator we need at a European level </s>    <s id="1:18">also wenn die das schaffen euh einen Regulator für euh einen einzigen Regulator einzusetzen dann werden wir in einer peinlichen Lage sein wenn wir's nicht schaffen</s>

     <s id="1:20">but we also need to make sure that we continue to push for the changes under the De Larosière issues which have thrown up and also on the group support which bring about economic efficiency</s>    <s id="1:20">wir müssen aber weiterhin die Änderungen in euh Zuge des euh De Larosière euh</s>

     <s id="1:7">many lies have been told and I use that word guardedly when I say lies with regard to what we are trying to do here</s>    <s id="1:7">viele Lügen wurden erzählt und ich sag das absichtlich Lügen Lügen man hat immer Lügen ausgesprochen über das was wir erreichen wollen man das zusammenfassen</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">this can be condensed down very simply into four very clear areas </s>    <s id="1:8">es gibt vier verschiedene Bereiche</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">first of all the extension of the term of protection from the present fifty years to a further extension of term</s>    <s id="1:9">erstens die Ausweitung der Schutzdauer von fünfzig Jahren auf hm einen weiteren Zeitraum</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">we are now proposing as part of a compromise seventy years</s>    <s id="1:10">siebzig Jahre wurde vorgeschlagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">that proposal for compromise is founded on some of the resistance from the Council of Ministers</s>    <s id="1:11">das ist ein Kompromissvorschlag und zwar auf der Grundlage euh auch aus der des Rates ja teilweise ist aber der Rat gegen diese siebzig Jahre</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and it disappoints me that the Council Presidency is not represented here tonight</s>    <s id="1:12">und ich bedauere es dass der Rat nicht vollständig anwesend ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">in fact all during this process I feel the Council Presidency hasn't been too helpful in trying to bring this issue forward</s>    <s id="1:13">und er hat uns nicht immer unterstützt</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">at the outset of the Czech Presidency I advised the prime minister as well as the minister with responsibility and the officials from the Czech Presidency that this could be a great success for the Presidency as well as a success for this Parliament</s>    <s id="1:14">zu Beginn der tschechischen Präsidentschaft möchte ich auch der Ministerpräsidentin und der federführenden Minister und die Beamten der tschechischen Präsidentschaft hinweisen dass dies doch ein Erfolg für die tschechischen Präsidentschaft und das Parlament sein könnte</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">but other pressures came to bear upon them </s>    <s id="1:15">aber euh ein anderer Druck lastete auf der tschechischen Präsidentschaft</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and they have taken a disinterested or semi-detached attitude with regard to trying to find solutions </s>    <s id="1:16">und sie haben sich deswegen zurückgezogen und sie haben nicht unbedingt immer voller Intensität versucht Lösungen herbeizuführen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">as well as that other member states within the Council of Ministers have purposely tried to block and hinder the progress in this process by putting in spurious claims and spurious amendments without actually looking at the detail or the content or even to engage properly with Parliament to see how the Parliament could be flexible with regard to what needs to happen </s>    <s id="1:17">auch andere Länder im Ministerrat haben absichtlich versucht hier Fortschritte zu verhindern sie haben hier Änderungsanträge eingereicht die nicht zielgerichtet waren und sie haben sich überhaupt nicht den Inhalt des Berichtes angesehen und sie haben gar nicht versucht mit dem Parlament zu diskutieren um herauszufinden ob das Parlament flexibel sein könnte</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">but the second point with regard to what this directive is doing and possibly the most important of all is that for the first time it recognizes the contribution of session musicians by establishing a fund to allow them to ensure that they have a return and remuneration for their work which has been exploited by people over a long period of time for which they may only get a one-off payment if they're lucky enough to get that </s>    <s id="1:18">aber ein zweiter Punkt ist wichtig und der ist vielleicht am wichtigsten zum ersten Mal wird festgestellt dass es auch Studiomusiker gibt und diese werden nun in ihrem Wert aufgewertet sie werden einen Fond haben der von Personen gemanagt wird und sie werden eine Zahlung bekommen also in der Vergangenheit hatten sie nur ein Mal das Glück überhaupt Zahlungen aus diesem Fond zu bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and this will ensure that those who are coming near the end of their playing careers or those who may have other economic issues with regard to them can get further protection from it</s>    <s id="1:19">und das führt dazu dass andere Personen euh dass nun diese Personen mehr Schutz haben als zuvor</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">thirdly with regard to the whole area of balancing the rights and the powers of those who are in negotiation between the record companies and the musicians it gives extra rights to musicians and to others to ensure that can happen</s>    <s id="1:20">dann komme ich zum dritten Bereich man braucht einen Ausgleich dieser Urheberrechte und man braucht auch einen Ausgleich derjenigen die aushandeln zwischen den Studiomusikern und den Plattenfirmen dadurch haben die Musiker mehr Rechte als in der Vergangenheit</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">fourthly and most importantly of all by ensuring that there is clarity with regard to how the law operates within the European Union </s>    <s id="1:21">und viertens und das ist am wichtigsten nun wird gewährleistet dass es Klarheit gibt in Bezug auf die Umsetzung dieses Gesetzes</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">many of my colleagues particularly those in Spain and other mediterranean countries have put forward ideas with regard to the audiovisual sector</s>    <s id="1:22">viele meiner Kollegen vor allem in Spanien und in Mittelmeerländern haben verschiedene Vorschläge für den audiovisuellen Sektor vorgetragen</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">and we have tried to accommodate them by putting into the draft directive the draft report this idea of having a separate directive to deal with the audiovisual sector because it is different issues that relate to it and requires different solutions</s>    <s id="1:23">wir haben versucht das Ganze in Übereinstimmung mit unserem Text zu bringen indem wir diese Idee aufgenommen haben dass man vielleicht eine getrennte euh Richtlinie euh formulieren sollte zum audiovisuellen Sektor weil man da andere Lösungen benötigt</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">likewise as has been discovered during the course of our debates and discussions there is a huge area with regard to the management of the collection societies and how they best represent the rights and the collection management of the monies that are due to artists to ensure that they can come towards them</s>    <s id="1:24">und das haben wir vor allem während unseren Debatten festgestellt es gibt auch noch die Frage der euh Verwaltung der Urheberverwaltungsgesellschaften und wie diese am besten das Geld verwalten können</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">and finally could I just say people should realise this is a creative right this is something that an individual has created and has given to us</s>    <s id="1:25">und zum Abschluss es handelt sich hierbei um Urheberrechte um Rechte an einem geschaffenen Werk</s>

     <s id="1:26">it is something that we should pay for not an exorbitant amount but a small amount</s>    <s id="1:26">und dafür sollten wir auch zahlen nicht unbedingt einen großen Betrag aber doch einen kleinen Betrag</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">the idea of copyright today is seen to be thrown away at the wind that everybody can get everything for free</s>    <s id="1:27">und das Konzept des Urheberrechtes wird heut' immer wieder vergessen man denkt dass man alles kostenlos bekommen kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">if we go down that road in the short term it may be all great for us but in the long term it will kill creativity it will kill the opportunity for new musicians for new bands for new experiences to come before us all</s>    <s id="1:28">und wenn man das tun wird dann werden alle dafür zahlen und dann wird dies auch die Kreativität euh abtöten dann wird es keine neuen Bands geben dann wird es keine neuen Musiker geben</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">in our audience tonight we have some musicians some producers and indeed some interested parties</s>    <s id="1:29">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">NONE</s>    <s id="1:30">und dann das wäre nur wenige Gruppen interessant</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">and I would say to them that this is the first step that we see on the stage towards guaranteeing that artists and musicians can take more control of what their rights are</s>    <s id="1:31">und ich denke man muss wirklich einen Schritt unternehmen um zu gewährleisten dass Musiker und Künstler wirklich auch mehr Einfluss auf ihre Rechte haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">if we succeed in this first step you can guarantee we can move on to the next steps towards Everest</s>    <s id="1:32">und wenn wir diesen ersten Schritt machen können dann können wir sicherlich auch den nächsten Schritt hin zum Mount Everest machen</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">thank you all very much</s>    <s id="1:33">NONE</s>

#
     <s id="1:2">and again I'd like to thank colleagues for their contribution to this debate</s>    <s id="1:2">und ich möchte mich erneut bei den Kollegen für ihre Beiträge bedanken</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">unfortunately I think despite all our discussions and our proposal and amendments and further re-amendments of amendments and the euh changes that have taken place some colleagues still have not grasped euh the way that this situation has moved on</s>    <s id="1:3">trotz der Diskussion zu den euh Vorschlägen und den Veränderungen und euh neue Änderungsanträge und so weiter euh ist wohl leider so dass manche immer noch nicht ganz verstanden haben in welche Richtung sich die Situation entwickelt hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">and I must say on a very personal level I mean I can appreciate everybody's viewpoint and understand where they are coming from</s>    <s id="1:4">ich euh verstehe euh natürlich die Meinung vieler Kollegen kann sie nachvollziehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">but it is difficult when we get amendments from colleagues which attached to it an article in the Financial Times saying that we should vote against copyright when at the bottom of that article from the Financial Times it says copyright protected so even the Financial Times which is opposed to copyright protection or extension use the copyright tool itself</s>    <s id="1:5">aber wenn man hier im euh bei der Financial Times euh liest euh dass man sich hier gegen die Urheberrechte stimmen sollte und selbst also diese Zeitung euh das euh Instrument so heranzieht dann ist das natürlich etwas euh schwierig</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and likewise when I hear consumer organisations saying that it's wrong to extend copyright 'cause this will interfere with consumers'  rights and consumer choices again not realising or not giving credence to the fact that copyright already exists and those rights and protection are already there</s>    <s id="1:6">und gleichzeitg wenn ich höre dass die Verbraucherorganisationen sagen dass es falsch ist die Schutzdauer zu verlängern weil es sei gegen die Verbraucherrechte und Interessen läuft also da denkt man nicht daran dass es euh Urheberrechte bereits gibt und dass eine Schutzdauer bereits da ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and likewise when I hear colleagues mentioning about the euh lack of or the inhibition that this will put in place euh the imposition of this would place on innovation and creativity</s>    <s id="1:7">und manche Kollegen sagen auch dass das euh bedeuten würde dass euh da die Kreativität eingeschränkt würde</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">how will people create anything if they cannot protect their rights if they can't protect their creations</s>    <s id="1:8">wie würde jemand denn überhaupt etwas schaffen wollen wenn man das nicht schützen kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">how will they do it</s>    <s id="1:9">wie sollen sie denn da euh überhaupt vorgehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and likewise people who speak about merchandising or the mercantiling as was the translation of the record industry wake up and smell the coffee that has been there since the year dot</s>    <s id="1:10">und wenn wir über die euh Vermarktung sprechen euh von Seiten der Plattenfirmen ja da das war doch schon immer so</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">NONE</s>    <s id="1:11">da wird sich eigentlich nichts ändern</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">before recorded music ever came into being when you bought sheet music you had to pay a certain fee that went back to the creator of that music and every time it was performed the performer got a cut from it as well </s>    <s id="1:12">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">NONE</s>    <s id="1:13">also es wär' immer so dass euh da euh bestimmte Gebühren zurückgehen an den Künstler nicht wahr also dieser Prozess wird ja nicht verändert</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">so what we're talking about is putting balance and fairness into the argument ensuring that the rights of those who are weakest in contractual terms who are weakest in enforcement terms and those who are coming near the end of their playing career or their musical careers so that they can get protection and get uses</s>    <s id="1:14">wir wollen ja nur euh das Ganze gerechter gestalten und sicherstellen dass die Rechte derjenigen die hier am schwächsten sind gestärkt werden also wenn es um Fragen der Verträge geht um euh die eigentliche Umsetzung dass sie euh einen besseren Schutz genießen am Ende</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and I think it's important that people recognise that despite the advent of new technology we all welcome new technology it's but new technology doesn't mean that you've the right to take something for nothing </s>    <s id="1:15">und ich halte es für wichtig dass euh man erkennt dass man trotz der neuen Technologie die wir ja alle auch sehr gut finden aber dass man mit dieser neuen Technologie nicht euh glauben kann dass man nichts mehr bezahlen muss</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">new technology doesn't mean that compared to where before you went into a record store and you took a CD or an old vinyl record of the label and walked over that you would be caught for shoplifting</s>    <s id="1:16">früher hat man euh eine Platte euh gekauft oder eine CD im euh Geschäft wenn man dafür nicht bezahlt hat wurde man da aber schnell bestraft und des Diebstahls euh bezichtigt</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">likewise downloading music free of charge without paying a fee to somebody is equal to that </s>    <s id="1:17">NONE</s>

     <s id="1:18">NONE</s>    <s id="1:18">also das jetzt euh im Internet einfach runterzuladen oder ähnliches das kann man sich nicht so vorstellen</s>

     <s id="1:19">it's about allowing for proper mechanisms to be put in place</s>    <s id="1:19">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">I want to thank miss Chairman I want to thank Jacques Toubon Neena Gill and all of my colleagues for their help and assistance and I particularly want to thank Mister Medina Ortega for his useful euh guidance and advice and helping me out of a problem with the Spanish hum side in particular  </s>    <s id="1:20">also ich möchte mich bei Allen noch einmal bedanken beim Kommissar bei Neena Gill bei den anderen Mitarbeitern auch bei Herrn Medina Ortega für seine euh guten Ratschläge euh dass sie mir hier  insbesondere bei den Spaniern weitergeholfen haben</s>

     <s id="1:2">euh I would like to congratulate misses Frassoni on her report</s>    <s id="1:2">ich danke Frau Frassoni für ihren Bericht</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">I think she and I now over a period of two or three years have enjoyed working together euh on this report on behalf of the Parliament</s>    <s id="1:3">sie und ich haben jetzt zwei drei Jahre lang also sehr erfolgreich zusammengearbeitet euh in dieser Frage im Namen des Parlaments</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">euh that cooperation I have enjoyed</s>    <s id="1:4">diese Zusammenarbeit war positiv</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">I do not enjoy the fact that we seem to end up every year repeating much the same things and having a certain sense euh that we are going round and round in circles </s>    <s id="1:5">aber es ist nicht positiv dass wir erneut fast jedes Jahr immer wieder die gleiche Leier spielen müssen nämlich euh dass wir einfach sagen müssen wir drehen uns nur im Kreis</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">it ought to be pretty simple because this is about our citizens being able to see what European law is when is a problem to be able to see what the enforcement process is and finally to see the result of that enforcement</s>    <s id="1:6">es sollte eigentlich eine einfache Übung sein denn hier geht es schließlich um die Bürger damit die handgreiflich euh erfassen was europäische Gesetze bedeuten und wie das Durchsetzungsverfahren genau läuft und letztendlich welche Ergebnisse diese Durchführung und Durchsetzungen haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">but as it is we seem to have to keep trying to invent new mechanisms all the time to actually deal with a process that's already there but it isn't obvious and isn't transparent </s>    <s id="1:7">aber de facto scheinen wir weiterhin neue Mechanismen immer wieder suchen zu müssen damit der bereits bestehende Prozess euh überhaupt läuft der nicht euh verständlich und transparent ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">now we've made some progress in that the beginning of the process in the sense of making EU law understandable has now been taken on board by the Commission</s>    <s id="1:8">gewisse Fortschritte hatten wir erzielt zu Beginn des ganzen Verfahrens nämlich als man gesagt hat das EU-Recht muss jetzt verständlich werden das hat die Kommission jetzt übernommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and I am pleased that we now see with some regularity so-called citizens' summaries prefacing pieces of legislation so that we can all see and those that we represent can see where we ought to be heading and what the law ought to achieve</s>    <s id="1:9">ich bin froh dass wir jetzt euh mit einer gewissen Regelmäßigkeit sogenannte Bürgerzusammenfassungen kriegen also für die Öffentlichkeit wo bestimmte Themenkreise anhand der dafür bestimmten und beschlossenen Gesetze dargestellt werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">but when it comes to the enforcement process we still seem to be in a position where the decision to enforce or not is less than obvious why that decision may or may not be taken</s>    <s id="1:10">aber bei der Durchsetzung da scheint das nach wie vor so zu sein dass euh die Entscheidung das zu verfolgen oder nicht durchzusetzen das ist eher eine Frage der Willkürlichkeit</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">euh and citizens are often euh left wondering</s>    <s id="1:11">und die Bürger die wundern sich oft was da läuft</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">we've had a letter that came to us recently</s>    <s id="1:12">unlängst kriegten wir ein Schreiben</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">somebody who had tried to get a piece of legislation enforced is now so disgusted with the whole European set-up having been pro-European that they now go off euh to support an anti-European party </s>    <s id="1:13">da hat jemand versucht ein Gesetz durchzubringen also zur Durchführung zu bringen er war also ein Europafreund und jetzt ist er so frustriert dass er sich einsetzt für eine Europagegner-Partei</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and that's the point </s>    <s id="1:14">und darum geht's</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">if we do not get this right we bring the whole of European law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute </s>    <s id="1:15">wenn die Sache nicht klappt wird das gesamte europäische Gesetz und wird die gesamten EU-Institutionen in Misskredit gebracht</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">it is as serious as that</s>    <s id="1:16">so schlimm ist das</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and all of us as members in these last days of this mandate are spending our time tearing around going from trialogue to trialogue and first-reading agreement to first-reading agreement arguing about sets of words the contents of sentences in legislation</s>    <s id="1:17">und in den letzten Tagen des Mandats kämpfen wir alle von Dialog zu erster Lesung und so weiter und argumentieren um Wörtchen um gewisse Kommata in Gesetzgebungsartikeln</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">that's great but if at the end of the day it isn't enforced and it isn't enforced in the way that our citizens expect  we might ask ourselves what is the point</s>    <s id="1:18">schön und gut aber wenn letztendlich das Ganze nicht durchgesetzt wird oder so nicht durchgesetzt wird wie es der Bürger erwartet da können wir uns überhaupt fragen was soll denn die ganze Sache</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">all of our institutions have a responsibility concerning the monitoring of EU law</s>    <s id="1:19">alle unsere Institutionen haben hier eine Mitverantwortung bei der Überwachung des EU-Gesetzes</s>

     <s id="1:20">you Commission have the primary responsibility</s>    <s id="1:20">Sie Herr Kommissar haben die Hauptverantwortung</s>

     <s id="1:21">and I wish in a way that we didn't have to have this debate in this style every year</s>    <s id="1:21">und mir wär's lieb wenn wir solche Debatten in dieses Lesart nicht jedes Jahr führen müssen</s>

#
     <s id="1:4">and I know that was perhaps some disappointment from you that we felt that we weren't able to give this proposal a thorough review and to get it to first reading euh before the end of this mandate but I think history will show that we done the right thing </s>    <s id="1:4">ich weiß dass da gewisse euh Enttäuschung von Ihnen euh zu spüren war weil wir nicht in der Lage waren diesen Vorschlag gründlich zu bearbeiten und ihn vor Ende dieses Mandats auch noch euh durch eine erste Lesung zu bringen aber die Geschichte wird zeigen dass wir das Richtige gemacht haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">euh because the work that's been led very well by Arlene McCarthy looking at the impact assessment questioning the issues hum I think has raised awareness in the proposal but also got many more people engaged as you yourself indicated</s>    <s id="1:5">denn die euh Arbeit die von Arlene McCarthy schön vorgegeben wurde also die Auswirkungsfragen und so weiter das hat sicher das Bewusstsein gesteigert im Bezug auf diesen Vorschlag es wurden aber auch mehr Leute jetzt auch wirklich interessiert und haben sich eingebracht</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">I think it seems to me and these are the crucial points I just want to make in the short time available this evening euh is that I feel that one important thing that's missing from this proposal euh is the overall strategic framework that the Commission wants to follow in the evolution of the consumer acquis</s>    <s id="1:6">es wurden hier euh ich sollte jetzt hier eigentlich in meiner kurzen Rede zweierlei sagen erstens bin ich der Auffassung dass ein wichtiges Element das fehlt in diesem Vorschlag der globale Strategierahmen ist den die Kommission bei der Evolution des euh Verbraucheracquis folgen möchte</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">euh this proposal addresses goods euh but at the end of this year before we have this proposal in place euh we shall have the services directive in place</s>    <s id="1:7">es werden hier Güter behandelt bei diesem Vorschlag aber euh euh am Ende des Jahres euh werden wir ja auch noch die Dienstleistungsrichtlinie haben vor Ende</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and there are many issues for consumers around that</s>    <s id="1:8">und da gibt's ja auch ziemlich viele Verbraucherfragen die damit zusammenhängen</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">we know that you're also looking at issues like digital products package travel and so on</s>    <s id="1:9">und dann gibt's auch noch die digitalen euh Erzeugnisse euh Pakete und euh Reisen und so weiter euh Pauschalreisen für Sightseeing und so weiter</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">euh I think we actually need to see what you intend to do with this goods package as part of a broader strategy for the direction of the consumer acquis </s>    <s id="1:10">es wird interessant euh sein festzustellen was sie mit diesen Vorschlag als euh Teil eines gesamten Verbraucheracquis zu tun gedenken</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">that I think is very important it needs to be future-proofed it needs to be part of an overall process</s>    <s id="1:11">das muss ja sozusagen auch für die Zukunft armiert werden muss Teil eines Globalansatzes sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and I think that's one of the things that I would be euh slightly critical about in the approach that's been taken so far </s>    <s id="1:12">NONE</s>

#
     <s id="1:15">and we've assured them that their report will be able to have a material contribution on the outcome given the time we have available and we look forward in the end to an extremely good result for Europe's consumers and the internal market       </s>    <s id="1:15">und wir hatten mit denen gesprochen wir hatten denen gesagt dass deren Bericht ein wesentlicher Beitrag zu unserem Ergebnis sein würde und wir sehen einem sehr guten Ergebnis für die europäischen Verbraucher und den Binnenmarkt entgegen</s>

     <s id="1:3">euh a number of points came up in the debate not least hum in relation on anti-discrimination and how important such measures are even in times of hum euh of economic downturn</s>    <s id="1:3">einige Punkte sind ja angeklungen in dieser Debatte da ging es auch um Antidiskriminierung und die Bedeutung dieser Maßnahmen in Zeiten des wirtschaftlichen Abschwungs</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">and the point was raised about euh the work that we've done with the women's committee on this issue</s>    <s id="1:4">da wurde auch erwähnt was im Frauenausschuss hierzu geschehen ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">also the issue was raised about mutual support</s>    <s id="1:5">und dann war noch die Frage der gegenseitigen Unterstützung angeklungen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and I want to stress here one of the dimensions that we've raised in the hum inclusion report which is that about the local level and certain of the dimensions about local economy  </s>    <s id="1:6">und ich möchte hervorheben welche Dimension uns hier wichtig war nämlich die lokale Ebene im Integrationsbericht und zwar über die lokale Wirtschaft</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">we talk a lot about national international economy here but the local economy is hm crucially important</s>    <s id="1:7">es geht ja um die internationale nationale Wirtschaft aber auch die lokale Ebene ist sehr wichtig</s>

     <s id="1:8">people's access to banking hum even if they're not very well off to microcredit and to credit unions</s>    <s id="1:8">der Zugang zu den Banken auch für jene die nicht allzu viel Geld haben Zugang zu Mikrokrediten und so weiter</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">hum and I think we going to need to beware poorer people finding themselves being pushed more and more into debt at very very high interest levels through loan sharks and the like</s>    <s id="1:9">und ich glaube die Armen werden immer mehr in die Verschuldung getrieben und müssen Wucherzinsen zahlen</s>

     <s id="1:11">that that really eats away at people</s>    <s id="1:11">NONE</s>

     <s id="1:12">but in terms of the local authority dimension and the services dimension that we talked about as well in connection with the report</s>    <s id="1:12">was die lokale Dimension die Dimension der Dienstleistungen betrifft auch darum ist es ja gegangen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">another area that the committee particularly wanted to stress was hum the subject of housing</s>    <s id="1:13">da möchte ich noch einen Bereich hervorheben nämlich das Thema euh hm Wohnungen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">because again in times of economic downturn there is more and more pressure on people who maybe find themselves unable to afford the housing that they were in</s>    <s id="1:14">denn zur Zeit des wirtschaftlichen Abschwungs ist es oft so dass man sich eine Wohnung nicht mehr leisten kann die man bewohnt</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and therefore there is really going to be a need to concentrate on that level </s>    <s id="1:15">und auch darauf muss man sich konzentrieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and perhaps we could use the open method of coordination to look at best practice hum across member states</s>    <s id="1:16">vielleicht anhand der offenen Koordinierungsmethode um bewährte Praktiken zu prüfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and finally a word on the social fund</s>    <s id="1:17">und dann ein Wort zum Sozialfond</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">we're very concerned that this doesn't get brought into a very very narrow dimension about what constitutes employment and preparedness for employment </s>    <s id="1:18">das darf man nicht verengt sehen na was nämlich Beschäftigung ist und wie man sich hier wappnen kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">so that we don't want to lose a lot of the imaginative and very productive and interesting schemes which have been helping people for so long find their way into employment from very difficult starting points </s>    <s id="1:19">da gilt es Fantasie walten zu lassen interessante Programme zu finden um die Menschen wieder auf den Arbeitsmarkt zu bringen</s>

     <s id="1:2">and to the rapporteurs to thank them for their tremendous amount of work that they've done on these reports</s>    <s id="1:2">ich möchte den Berichterstattern danken für ihre Arbeit</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">and again as we said in an earlier debate coming at a very important time when people are actually looking for answers and looking for ideas on how to move forward</s>    <s id="1:3">und wir haben ja schon in der Vergangenheit gesagt dass es also euh wirklich sehr wichtig ist dass wir hier neu antworten und Gedanken finden müssen für die Zukunft</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">I suppose in many ways these can be divided up into four separate yet linked areas</s>    <s id="1:4">und euh da haben wir vier verschiedenen Bereiche die sind getrennt zu sehen hängen aber doch zusammen</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">firstly with regard to education and training whether it's lifelong learning or upskilling of existing people or new skills to give to people </s>    <s id="1:5">da geht erst einmal um die Erziehung und Unterricht egal ob des jetzt euh lebenslanges Lernen ist oder die Vermittlung neuer Kenntnisse</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">secondly the whole area of innovation about looking to see where jobs are going to come into future and making sure people have the skills and the training for that</s>    <s id="1:6">dann innovative Maßnahmen welche Arbeitsplätze für die Zukunft von Bedeutung sind und wie man die weiter ausbauen kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">thirdly the whole area with regard to sustainability that people who are already at work that they're given protections and given certain supports now to make sure they don't lose their job and have to go through the cycle of retraining and upskilling for another year or two year's time to get another job to maintain the existing jobs that are there</s>    <s id="1:7">als Drittes die Nachhaltigkeit der gesamte Sektor der Nachhaltigkeit dass diejenigen die arbeiten geschützt sind und dass sie vor allen Dingen auch gesichert sind vor Arbeitsplatzverlust und euh dass sie euh euh für euh nicht euh ein oder zwei euh Jahre verlieren mit einer Umschulung bis sie dann eventuell einen neuen Arbeitsplatz bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and fourthly to try and anticipate if that is possible where we need to move for the future</s>    <s id="1:8">und euh dann euh euh Vorgriff auf die Entwicklung in der euh Zukunft</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">if colleagues will think back to the early nineteen nineties when we had the whole Delors plan with the white paper and the social package and so on</s>    <s id="1:9">wenn wir die Neunzigerjahre uns nochmal ansehen mit dem Delors Plan Sozialpaketen und so weiter</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">this was being seen as groundbreaking and innovative </s>    <s id="1:10">da euh wissen wir dass es alles als sehr innovativ betrachtet wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and it contained within it many difficult dossiers and many difficult ideas which many people in the industry in particular were opposed to but also uniquely in where a lot of people involved in trade union movment were against as well </s>    <s id="1:11">und wir wissen dass dazu die verschiedendsten Dossiers und Gedanken enthalten waren vor allen Dingen hat man von Seiten der Industrie Opposition gehört aber auch bei den Gewerkschaften gab es Widerstand</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">and if our experience since nineteen ninety four can show us anything it is that first of all we must ensure that all social policy is predicated on the basis of delivering results for people not just merely massaging numbers or figures but actually making people's lives better</s>    <s id="1:12">und unsere Erfahrungen aus neunzehnhundertvierundneunzig haben zum Beispiel gezeigt dass es ganz anders aussieht dass wir erst einmal sicherstellen müssen dass die gesamte Sozialpolitik so ausgerichtet sein muss dass die Menschen in den Genuss euh von euh Fortschritten kommen es geht nicht um Steigerungen von Zahlen sondern dass das Leben für die Menschen besser ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">secondly that no matter how good your training or educations or skills may be there are people who will be caught in unemployment and they must be guaranteed a safety net and a security to allow them to euh have a proper and decent standard of living </s>    <s id="1:13">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">NONE</s>    <s id="1:14">und dass die Ausbildung und Erziehung so ausgerichtet und konzipiert sind dass die Menschen geeignet sind für die vorhandene euh euh Arbeitsgelegenheiten und dass sie auch einigermaßen sicher sein können dass sie ihr euh Erwerbsleben lang euh ihr Auskommen finden</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and as well as that as president Barroso rightly mentioned himself despite high employment participation levels in many countries over the last number of years people with disabilities seventy four per cent of people with disabilities were unemployed despite the fact they'd access to education and training because of the psychological barrier and blockage that there was </s>    <s id="1:15">und euh dann müssten wir sehen dass euh trotz euh großer euh Arbeitslosigkeit in vielen Ländern Menschen mit euh Behinderungen euh euh immer wieder euh besonders euh schlecht dran waren bis zu vierundsiebzig Prozent euh der euh Betreffenden euh sind euh euh nicht euh in der Lage eine Arbeit zu finden</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">finally mister President and I am sorry for having gone on so long finally just to sum up very briefly an old saying give a man a fish you feed him for a day teach a man to fish you feed him for life </s>    <s id="1:16">und weil ich schon etwas zu lange spreche euh wenn euh euh einen Menschen einen Fisch gibt dann hat er ein Tag sein Auskommen wenn man ihn lehrt zu fischen ist er sein Leben lang versorgt</s>

#
     <s id="1:4">the sources of the reforms that we would hope to introduce to our rules of procedure come in part from the work of the reform working group established by the conference of presidents ably chaired by my colleague Dagmar Roth-Behrendt and who made a number of proposals that were approved by the Conference of Presidents and have been forwarded to us to translate as best we can into the rules of procedure</s>    <s id="1:4">wir hoffen unsere Geschäftsordnung einer Reform unterziehen zu können und das geht zum Teil zurück auf die Arbeit der Reformarbeitsgruppe die die Konferenz der Präsidenten eingesetzt hat euh hm Dagmar Roth-Behrendt hat da den Vorsitz geführt und wir haben ja viele euh Vorschläge der Konferenz der Präsidenten übernommen und so gut wie möglich umgesetzt im Text für die Geschäftsordnung</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">the second source is a lot of smaller changes that in many ways have been in the pipeline for a long time</s>    <s id="1:5">eine zweite Quelle der Änderungen sind Dinge die schon seit längerer Zeit in der Diskussion standen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">but rather than have a string of reports changing the rules on minor points we have grouped them together </s>    <s id="1:6">aber euh statt nun etliche Berichte zu machen um verschiedene Dinge zu regeln haben wir das alles  hier zusammengefasst</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">some of these are euh technical some of them are clarifying and making our rules more readable such as the one that puts together rule one four one one four two and one four three into a single codified text</s>    <s id="1:7">zum Teil sind es technische euh Änderungen zum Teil geht es darum unsere Geschäftsordnung etwas euh lesbarer zu machen wo zum Beispiel einzelne Artikel zu einem einzigen zusammengefasst wurden</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">governing how we actually organize our debates in plenary</s>    <s id="1:8">wenn es darum geht wie die Debatten im Plenum organisiert werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">NONE</s>    <s id="1:9">Artikel hunderteinundvierzig zweiundvierzig dreiundvierzig</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and related to that is the innovative amendment to say we should have this blue card procedure to be able to interrupt each other</s>    <s id="1:10">dann die Sache zum Beispiel mit den blauen Karten um euh die Möglichkeit euh zu bieten jemanden zu unterbrechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">mister Duff for instance right now may want to put a question to me about what I said and I would let him do so for thirty seconds under this rule if it is adopted</s>    <s id="1:11">also Herr Duff könnte jetzt zum Beispiel die blaue Karte heben und beantragen mich zu unterbrechen um direkt ne Frage zu stellen für dreißig euh Sekunden</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">I'm sure mister President you would already let him do so now if he wanted but fortunately he doesn't want it</s>    <s id="1:12">also Herr Präsident wenn er das möchte würden Sie ihm wahrscheinlich jetzt schon die Gelegenheit bieten aber leider will er das ja gar nicht</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">so there are some innovative features that should make our debates a little bit more lively</s>    <s id="1:13">aber wie dem auch sei es gibt so einige innovative Aspekte die unsere Diskussion hoffentlich n bisschen lebendiger machen werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">I remember when I first proposed euh to have a catch-the-eye period at the end of ordinary debates everyone said oh no we can't do that it will mess up the speaking time of the groups and so on</s>    <s id="1:14">ich hatte ursprünglich mal euh vorgesehen dass man auch bei ganz normalen euh Diskussionen dieses Catch-the-eye-Verfahren haben diese Minutenreden da hieß es immer nein können wir doch nicht machen viel zu kompliziert ja</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">yet we now do it and it's an accepted part of our procedures and very welcome I think by most members </s>    <s id="1:15">und inzwischen machen wir es und es wird praktiziert und die meisten Abgeordneten begrüßen das</s>

     <s id="1:16">I would suggest that maybe the blue-card procedure will be the same there are some hesitations now</s>    <s id="1:16">ich denke mit dem Verfahren mit der blauen Karte da zögert man jetzt auch n bisschen aber ich könnte mir vorstellen dass das genau so läuft</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">but let's try it out let's see how it works</s>    <s id="1:17">und wir sollten's einfach mal probieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and I'm confident we can make it work </s>    <s id="1:18">und ich bin sicher dass das gut klappen wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">there have also been some amendments that have come as we discussed this either at committee stage or now in plenary </s>    <s id="1:19">euh einige Änderungsanträge gehen zurück auf die Diskussionen im Ausschuss euh</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">NONE</s>    <s id="1:20">und dann geht's um die Frage wie sieht es aus euh das Verhältnis der Abstimmungen im Ausschuss beziehungsweise im Plenum</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">an euh suggestion we should for instance have all final votes on legislation by a roll-call vote automatically I think that came from misses Dahl</s>    <s id="1:21">euh euh Frau Dahl hat einmal euh vorgeschlagen dass bestimmte Dinge automatisch übernommen werden wenn da Einstimmigkeit vorherrschte</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">and I welcome that amendment </s>    <s id="1:22">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">we've put it in my report </s>    <s id="1:23">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">there've been suggestions from many members that we codify that we put something in the rule about intergroups if only actually to euh delimit very clearly what they euh that what they are and what they are not to show that they're informal and they may not take over the responsibilities of parliamentary bodies</s>    <s id="1:24">viele Abgeordnete haben gesagt wir sollten eine Kodifizierung vornehmen in Bezug auf die Intergruppen euh auch wenn es unter Umständen nur darum geht sehr deutlich abzugrenzen euh was sie sind und was sie nicht sind also um deutlich zu machen dass sie informell sind und nicht irgendwelche Verantwortung übernehmen können als ob sie reguläre Parlamentsgremien wären</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">so there's a lot of interesting things in here</s>    <s id="1:25">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">NONE</s>    <s id="1:26">also es gibt hier eine Menge Interessen die zu Buche schlagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">there's also the amendments to deal with the odd system we have that our opening session is chaired by the oldest member hum instead of for instance the outgoing president which happens in some parliaments or an outgoing vice-president even if the president euh were not re-elected perhaps so a rather sensible improvement to our procedures</s>    <s id="1:27">euh wir haben ja auch ein euh System das die Eröffnungssitzungen unter dem Vorsitz euh des euh ältesten Mitglieds tätigen in anderen Parlamenten ist es zum Beispiel dann eben der euh ausscheidende Präsident oder vielleicht auch euh Vizepräsident wie auch immer</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">but I'll wind up there I've not used all my time but I'll if I need to I am happy to come back at the end and answer questions or queries</s>    <s id="1:28">also es gibt einige Verbesserungen aber ich will jetzt euh hier zum Abschluss kommen ich habe nicht alle Redezeit benutzt bin aber gerne bereit am Ende gegebenenfalls nochmal darauf zurückzukommen und Fragen zu beantworten</s>

     <s id="1:1">may I first begin by thanking my shadow rapporteurs who have got to grips with the detail of this issue mister Szájer mister Duff misses Frassoni and misses Dahl</s>    <s id="1:1">ja zu allererst möchte ich mich bedanken bei meinen Schattenberichterstattern euh die mir sehr geholfen haben bei den Detailfragen ich denke an Herrn Szájer Herrn Duff Frau Frassoni und euh Frau Dahl</s>
#
     <s id="1:2">euh without their help and work we would not have been able to bring this work to fruition</s>    <s id="1:2">ohne ihre Hilfe und Kooperationsbereitschaft hätten wir diese Arbeit nicht so zustande bringen können</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">may I secondly confirm what has been mentioned already</s>    <s id="1:3">zum Zweiten möchte ich das bestätigen was bereits gesagt wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">this report was actually split into two</s>    <s id="1:4">dieser Bericht wurde eigentlich in zwei Teile aufgeteilt</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">there is another report which we have not brought to plenary yet which we will have to revisit in the next parliament concerning how we adapt our procedures to the Lisbon Treaty if it comes into force</s>    <s id="1:5">es gibt nämlich noch einen anderen Bericht den wir noch nicht ins Plenum gebracht haben im nächsten Parlament wird der wieder behandelt werden müssen und da geht es dann darum wie wir unsere Verfahren anpassen an den Lissabon Vertrag sofern er in Kraft tritt</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">we were of course doing looking at this as preparation without prejudice to the ratification that will hopefully take place tomorrow in the euh Czech senate and later in the year in Ireland but we will return to that with the preparatory work having been done hum if the treaty is ratified</s>    <s id="1:6">natürlich haben wir uns damit befasst schon in der Vorbereitung euh unbeschadet der Ratifizierung die hoffentlich morgen stattfinden wird im tschechischen Senat und später dann auch noch in Irland wir werden darauf aber wieder zurückkommen auf dem Hintergrund der bereits geleisteten Vorbereitungsarbeit wenn denn der Vertrag ratifiziert sein wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">second may I confirm that indeed the there are rules here which revisit as mister Szájer pointed out recent reforms that flowed from the first report of the euh of Dagmar Roth-Behrendt's reform working group</s>    <s id="1:7">euh zum Zweiten oder eigentlich zum Dritten darf ich bestätigen dass euh hier euh es einige Artikel gibt euh die wieder anknüpfen an euh bereits durchgeführte Reformen die sich euh ergaben aus dem Bericht der Reformarbeitsgruppe von Dagmar Roth-Behrendt</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and it concerns this question of initiative reports where we have a procedure which many members feel is a little bit too inflexible now</s>    <s id="1:8">dabei geht es um die Initiativberichte unter anderem das Verfahren ist nach Auffassung vieler Abgeordneter nicht flexibel genug</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">we've made it slightly more flexible</s>    <s id="1:9">wir haben es jetzt etwas flexibler gestaltet</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">for a start the debate will not just be a short presentation by the rapporteur a reply from the Commission and that's it there will be up to ten minutes of catch-the-eye possible for such occasions</s>    <s id="1:10">um die Diskussion zu beginnen wird es nicht nur eine kurze Darstellung des Berichterstatters und ne Antwort der Kommission geben sondern bis zu zehn Minuten Catch-the-Eye-Verfahren bei solchen Gelegenheiten</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">secondly when it comes to amendments these are now prohibited for own-initiative reports</s>    <s id="1:11">und dann wenn es um Änderungsanträge geht so sind die jetzt verboten bei Initiativberichten</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">instead groups can table an alternative motion for resolution</s>    <s id="1:12">stattdessen können die Fraktionen eine alternative Entschließung vorschlagen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">that right would continue but in addition we would allow amendments if they are tabled by a tenth of the members of the house </s>    <s id="1:13">dieses Recht wird weiterbestehen zusätzlich werden wir Veränderungsanträge zulassen wenn sie vorgelegt werden von einem Zehntel der Mitglieder des Hauses</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">mister Wielowieyski who's just left us has criticized that point</s>    <s id="1:14">euh der polnische Kollege hat eben diesen euh Punkt kritisiert</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">but at the moment there's no right to amend initiative reports whatsoever</s>    <s id="1:15">aber im Moment hat man kein Recht überhaupt irgendetwas zu ändern in Initiativberichten</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">this enables a restricted right</s>    <s id="1:16">hier ist zumindest ein eingeschränktes Recht möglich</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">we don't want to open the floodgates and have hundreds of amendments rewriting lengthy resolutions by a committee of seven-hundred-and-something members</s>    <s id="1:17">wir wollen jetzt nicht euh Tür und Tor öffnen und euh wollen jetzt dass euh euh siebenhundertfünfzig Ausschussmitglieder quasi eine Flut von Anträgen einbringen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">but on the other hand a limited right of amendment where there is a strong wish for it we felt was a reasonable compromise and a right balance</s>    <s id="1:18">wir wollen aber die Möglichkeit wenn sehr stark der Wunsch danach besteht euh doch in beschränktem Umfang Änderungsanträge in ausgehobenem Maße zulassen</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">another way in which a previous reform from a number of years ago is being revisited is of course the amendment by the ALDE group concerning recasting and I think that is also a welcome euh euh adjustment to the procedures that we have at the moment </s>    <s id="1:19">eine andere euh Art euh euh des Wiederaufgreifens von euh früheren Anträgen ist die Frage euh der euh der Rechtstexte die einer Neufassung unterworfen werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">may I also confirm that lots of new ideas have come from other members</s>    <s id="1:20">außerdem darf ich bestätigen dass viele neue Ideen von anderen Abgeordneten stammen</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">I mentioned some earlier</s>    <s id="1:21">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">I forgot to mention the article on the agora which indeed mister Botopoulos and mister Onesta can claim the paternity for</s>    <s id="1:22">einige habe ich eben euh nicht erwähnt zum Beispiel diesen Agora-Artikel euh das euh euh haben Herr Onesta und euh andere zu verantworten die können da die Vaterschaft quasi für sich in Anspruch nehmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">hum there's the hum hm there're other ideas on the roll-call voting hum for legislative reports not for all final votes but final votes on legislative reports which hum euh I think I did mention earlier</s>    <s id="1:23">und es geht auch euh um bestimmte Abstimmungsverfahren bei euh Legislativberichten nicht bei allen aber bei Legislativberichten aber ich glaube das habe ich eben auch schon gesagt</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">finally the points where I disagree with some members</s>    <s id="1:24">und schließlich gibt es noch Punkte bei denen ich mit einigen Abgeordneten nicht einig bin</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">mister Duff euh hm euh the rule on hum hm euh euh hm euh when there are a large number of amendments in plenary and the president can ask a committee to look at it it is not a referral back to committee of the report</s>    <s id="1:25">Herr Duff euh der Artikel euh euh euh zur Genehmigung von Änderungsanträgen im Plenum wo das dann euh hm wieder an den Ausschuss verwiesen werden kann da geht es nicht um eine Rückverweisung des gesamten Berichtes</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">the committee simply acts as a filter for the amendments in plenary so that we don't have to spend several hours voting but only on those amendments which have a certain degree of support</s>    <s id="1:26">der Ausschuss ist lediglich ein Filter für die euh Änderungsanträge im Plenum damit wir da nicht stundenlang abstimmen müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">it is not a referral back </s>    <s id="1:27">das heißt also nicht dass der ganze Bericht zurückverwiesen wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">second the point raised by miss Frassoni about opinion-giving committees having the right to table amendments in plenary</s>    <s id="1:28">und dann der Punkt von Frau Frassoni euh dass also euh auch im Plenum Ausschüsse die Stellungnahmen abgeben Änderungsanträge stellen dürfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">I must say I myself have grave doubts about that whether that is a good idea or not</s>    <s id="1:29">da muss ich sagen ich selbst bin auch nicht ganz sicher ob das ne gute Idee ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">but it came from the reform working group on which you sat</s>    <s id="1:30">aber das kommt aus der Reformarbeitsgruppe da waren Sie Mitglied</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">it was endorsed by the Conference of Presidents</s>    <s id="1:31">und die Konferenz der Präsidenten hat das unterstützt</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">hum that was euh euh something that had a degree of consensus behind it</s>    <s id="1:32">also da gab's ja offensichtlich doch ein hohes Maß an Konsens</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">and therefore we are submitting it to the house for approval or indeed rejection</s>    <s id="1:33">und aus diesem Grunde legen wir das hier vor natürlich kann das Parlament das auch ablehnen</s>
#
     <s id="1:34"> we will see how the house votes tomorrow</s>    <s id="1:34">wir werden sehen wie morgen die Abstimmung läuft</s>
#
     <s id="1:35">finally I won't address the Petitions-Committee issues because we are about to have a specific debate on that in a minute and I'll come back to that point then</s>    <s id="1:35">und schließlich möchte ich noch euh die Fragen zum Petitionsausschuss ansprechen wir haben ja dazu gleich sowieso noch ne ausgiebigere Diskussionen da können wir nochmal darauf ansprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:36">I'll just finally say in response to mister Gollnisch that mister Gollnish is wrong on two counts</s>    <s id="1:36">aber Herrn Gollnisch möchte ich sagen Herr Gollnisch hat Unrecht und zwar in zweierlei Hinsicht</s>
#
     <s id="1:37">this is not the same amendment that was rejected in committee</s>    <s id="1:37">es ist nicht der gleiche Antrag der im Ausschuss abgelehnt wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:38">it's a different one a different approach to the subject</s>    <s id="1:38">es ist n anderer es ist ein anderer Ansatz im Bezug auf das Thema</s>
#
     <s id="1:39">hum euh euh hm hm euh euh euh hm I had grave reservations about the amendment that was submitted in the committee </s>    <s id="1:39">euh ich habe große Vorbehalte im Bezug auf das was im Ausschuss eingebaut wurde</s>

     <s id="1:40">I'm happy to support the one that has been submitted to the plenary  </s>    <s id="1:40">wäre aber gerne bereit den Antrag zu unterstützen der hier im Plenum eingebracht wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:41">secondly the oldest member is not common to all parliaments of the world as he suggested it is not euh euh it is to many but it is by no means the only system that exists</s>    <s id="1:41">und zum Zweiten das älteste Mitglied euh als euh Präsident der Eröffnungssitzung des Parlamentes das ist durchaus nicht das einzige System das es gibt euh weltweit</s>
#
     <s id="1:42">and it's quite legitimate for us as a European Parliament to look at the various systems that exist and choose one which is suitable for our circumstances</s>    <s id="1:42">und es ist völlig legitim dass wir im Europäischen Parlament uns die verschiedenen Systeme die es gibt anschauen und das auswählen was uns am geeignetsten erscheint</s>
#
     <s id="1:43">it will be up to the house to decide</s>    <s id="1:43">und das wird das wird das Haus da zu entscheiden haben</s>

     <s id="1:23">our basic rule book in the European Union the treaties signed and ratified by member states can only ever be modified by the unanimous agreement of each and every single one of those member states</s>    <s id="1:23">unser Regelwerk in der Europäischen Union nämlich die Verträge hm die von den Mitgliedsstaaten euh unterzeichnet und ratifiziert werden euh können nur durch euh Einstimmigkeit euh hier verändert werden  Einstimmigkeit bedeutet alle Mitgliedsstaaten</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">that is a very high hurdle to reach</s>    <s id="1:24">und das ist eine hohe Hürde</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">it shows that those that claim that we are running roughshod over democratic accountability and ignoring the views of the people have got it completely the wrong way around</s>    <s id="1:25">und das zeigt euh dass diejenigen die sagen euh wir würden euh euh hier undemokratisch vorgehen euh und die Meinung euh des Volkes euh ignorieren euh völlig unrecht haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">it is very easy to block any step forward any reform of the European Instructions</s>    <s id="1:26">es ist einfach euh euh Fortschritte zu blockieren Reformen der europäischen Institutionen euh zu blockieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">those Eurosceptics over there only need one victory out of twenty seven the dice is loaded in their favour not in the favour of those who would like mister Duff want much more speedy integration that is the way it is</s>    <s id="1:27">diese Euroskeptiker da brauchen nur einen Sieg euh von sechsundzwanzig  euh möglichen aber nicht wie Herr Duff euh das möchte eine sehr viel schnellere Integration  Sie wollen ja gar keine</s>

#
     <s id="1:31">I think if you look at the history of the European Integration if you look at the history of European Integration there've been some thirty two if I remember correctly referendums in the member states over the years with twenty six of them twenty six or twenty seven giving a Yes result and only a handful giving a No result</s>    <s id="1:31">wenn Sie sich die Geschichte der Europäischen Integration anschauen euh dann gab es glaub ich euh zweiunddreißig Referenden in den Mitgliedsstaaten im Laufe der Jahre sechsundzwanzig oder siebenundzwanzig euh euh hatten das Ergebnis Ja und nur einige wenige das Ergebnis Nein</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">but whenever there has been a No result it has been impossible to override it without coming back and ask and addressing the concerns that were expressed and asking the country in question whether or not it wished to reconsider whether or not it wishes to change its mind</s>    <s id="1:32">aber wenn es euh ein Nein euh gibt euh dann euh ist es unmöglich euh weiter zu gehen ohne die euh Anliegen aufzugreifen die geäußert wurden und das fragliche Land euh zu fragen ob oder nicht euh sie euh bereit wären euh sich das zu überlegen und die Meinung zu ändern</s>
#
     <s id="1:33"> I find nothing wrong in democratic terms with that with building up gradually step by step slowly by means of consensus of all the member states this Union that we have worked on over half a century</s>    <s id="1:33">ich finde daran nichts falsch das ist demokratisch hier wird euh Schritt für Schritt euh mit euh Konsens euh aller Mitgliedsstaaten euh diese Union euh hier aufgebaut euh die es seit euh einem halben Jahrhundert gibt euh</s>

     <s id="1:3">why do we have to have you now re-elected for five years as Commission President</s>    <s id="1:3">weswegen müssen wir Sie jetzt wieder wählen zum Kommissionspräsidenten für fünf Jahren</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">well of course the answer is Ireland and the Lisbon Treaty</s>    <s id="1:4">nun gut ganz klar Irland und der Lissabonner Vertrag </s>
#
     <s id="1:5">the plan is to show everybody that the ship's steady that everything's going well that all the Irish have to do is to correct their rather silly little mistake</s>    <s id="1:5">der Plan besteht darin zu zeigen dass das Schiff in die klare Richtung geht festen Kurs hat und nur die Iren einfach ihren kleinen dummen Fehler korrigieren müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and indeed your working document is written as if the Treaty were already ratified</s>    <s id="1:6">und ihr Arbeitsdokument wird so geschrieben als ob der Vertrag bereits in Kraft getreten worden wäre</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">but there's a rather important point being missed here</s>    <s id="1:7">und es gibt noch 'n weiteren Punkt den man hier vergessen hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">you've been the boss you've been the governor for the last five years</s>    <s id="1:8">Sie sind ja hier der Boss  Sie waren in den letzten Jahren der Chef</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">you've been in charge of overseeing that the Constitutional Treaty was pushed through </s>    <s id="1:9">Sie waren derjenige der darauf achten musste dass der Verfassungsvertrag durchgesetzt wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">but of course things went wrong didn't they</s>    <s id="1:10">aber das Ganze ist falsch gelaufen nicht wahr</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">the French said No and the Dutch said No</s>    <s id="1:11">die Franzosen haben Nein gesagt  die Niederländer haben Nein gesagt</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">but you of course refused to accept these democratic results </s>    <s id="1:12">aber Sie waren natürlich nicht bereit diese demokratischen Ergebnisse zu berücksichtigen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and you took part with many members of this Parliament in the absolute deceit that is the Lisbon Treaty</s>    <s id="1:13">und mit vielen Mitgliedern dieses Parlamentes haben Sie wirklich diesen Betrug des Lissabonner Vertrags gepflegt</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">you told us that the flag and the anthem would be dropped but I've not seen much evidence of that</s>    <s id="1:14">Sie haben gesagt ja die Flagge wird gestrichen die Hymne wird gestrichen aber das habe ich nicht feststellen können</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">no you rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty</s>    <s id="1:15">jetzt hat das Ganze als Lissabonner Vertrag plötzlich genannt</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">but you couldn't stop the Irish from voting</s>    <s id="1:16">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">NONE</s>    <s id="1:17">aber die Iren die konnten's nicht stoppen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and the Irish of course said No</s>    <s id="1:18">und die Iren die haben Nein gesagt</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">but once again you couldn't accept a democratic result oh no the Irish have to vote again</s>    <s id="1:19">aber noch einmal konnten Sie ein demokratisches Ergebnis nicht akzeptieren und jetzt müssen die Iren noch einmal abstimmen</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">where in all of this given that you are in charge is the principle of democratic accountability</s>    <s id="1:20">ja Sie sind ja der Boss  Sie sind zuständig wo findet sich da die demokratische Rechenschaftspflicht</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">what you might argue that there isn't much democracy left in the European Union now</s>    <s id="1:21">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">NONE</s>    <s id="1:22">Sie sagen dass es kein demokratisches Defizit gibt</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">but there should at least be some degree of accountability</s>    <s id="1:23">aber es sollte doch eine Rechenschaftspflicht in einer gewissen Art und Weise geben</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">and I would argue that on the eve of what may well be a fourth rejection of this treaty the one that kills it off for good that this Parliament should not install you as Commission President for the next five years until we have that result </s>    <s id="1:24">und ich kann Ihnen sagen am Vortag einer möglichen vierten Abwahl dieses Vertrages sollte dieses Parlament Sie nicht zum Kommissionspräsidenten für die nächsten fünf Jahre wählen bevor wir nicht das klare Ergebnis haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">if the Irish people say No for a second time then we simply have to respect what they say and you have to go as President of the Commission</s>    <s id="1:25">wenn die Iren Nein sagen das ein zweites Mal tun dann müssen wir einfach das respektieren was sie sagen und dann müssen Sie gehen und dann sind Sie nicht mehr der Kommissionspräsident</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">it would happen in any other walk of life</s>    <s id="1:26">euh also in allen anderen Bereichen des Leben würde das so geschehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">it would happen in any business </s>    <s id="1:27">in allen anderen Unternehmen würde dies so geschehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">and I suggest that in European politics it really ought to happen </s>    <s id="1:28">und es sollte auch in der europäischen Politik so geschehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">and what about your record</s>    <s id="1:29">und wie sieht es aus mit Ihrer Bilanz</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">you know you've overseen the Lisbon agenda</s>    <s id="1:30">nun Sie haben die Lissabonner Agenda euh letztendlich überprüft</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">it was sunk without trace way before the credit crunch hits us</s>    <s id="1:31">aber bevor schon die Kritikkrise zugeschlagen hat hat das nicht funktioniert </s>
#
     <s id="1:32">now you're telling us we have to have a Commissioner for immigration taking away from nation states their most basic right to decide who comes to live work and settle in their countries</s>    <s id="1:32">jetzt sagen Sie plötzlich  oh wir brauchen einen Kommissar für Immigration damit die Mitgliedsländer ihre Grundrechte nicht mehr haben nämlich das Grundrecht zu entscheiden wer in ihrem Land leben arbeiten und sich niederlassen darf</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">you've pushed on with your obsession with climate change which has led to massive costs and no material benefits whatsoever</s>    <s id="1:33">Sie haben dann das ganze mit Klimawandel euh verbunden und euh da gibt es überhaupt keine finanziellen Vorteile</s>
#
     <s id="1:34">but above all it's when you ignored that Irish referendum it's when you said the Irish cannot stop this treaty for that reason alone I simply cannot support you</s>    <s id="1:34">aber am schlimmsten ist dass Sie dieses irische Referendum ignoriert haben Sie sagten die Iren können nicht diesen Vertrag stoppen das ist schon ein Grund genug um sie nicht hier unterstützen zu können</s>
#
     <s id="1:35">but it's possible that I've got this horribly wrong</s>    <s id="1:35">aber gut vielleicht täusche ich mich ja fürchterlich</s>
#
     <s id="1:36"> it's possible that you are the right man because yesterday in the Daily Telegraph a poll said if Lisbon goes through without a referendum would you want Britain to stay part of the European Union</s>    <s id="1:36">es vielleicht sind Sie der richtige Mann denn gestern habe ich im Daily Telegraph gelesen wenn Lissabon ohne eine Referendum durchgesetzt wird möchten Sie dann dass Großbritannien Mitglied der Europäischen Union bleibt</s>
#
     <s id="1:37">and by fourty three per cent to twenty six per cent for the first time in over thirty years a massive majority of Britons will want us to leave this European Union if mister Barroso gets his way</s>    <s id="1:37">und dreiundvierzig zu sechsundzwanzig Prozent haben zum ersten Mal in dreißig Jahren gesagt dass Sie ganz klar die Europäische Union verlassen wollen das wollen die Briten und gegen den Willen von Herrn Barroso</s>
#
     <s id="1:38">so maybe I've got it wrong maybe you're the right man we will see</s>    <s id="1:38">vielleicht sind Sie der richtige Mann vielleicht wird dann Großbritannien die Europäische Union verlassen wir werden das mal sehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:39">yes he's very happy to go</s>    <s id="1:39">und dann wären wir froh</s>

#
     <s id="1:2">first of all can I say I really feel very strongly the Commission were very late in acting on this particular problem </s>    <s id="1:2">zunächst einmal muss ich sagen dass ich das Gefühl habe dass die Kommission hier sehr spät gehandelt hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">they did sit on their hands too long and many farmers have suffered grievously for that</s>    <s id="1:3">die Kommission hat zu lange geschaut und gewartet und die Landwirte haben dafür die Zeche zahlen müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">NONE</s>    <s id="1:4">wir können natürlich helfen dem Sektor</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">we can decide to either help the industry or we can decide that we end up letting our farmers go out of business</s>    <s id="1:5">wir können natürlich entscheiden dem Sektor zu helfen oder aber wir entscheiden uns euh dafür dass euh die Landwirte ihre Betriebe schließen müssen</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and then we can import it from abroad with all the problems that that brings us</s>    <s id="1:6">und euh da müssen wir die Produkte importieren mit allen Problemen die damit behaftet sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">I have to say I welcome your remarks for the future Commissioner</s>    <s id="1:7">ich euh begrüße Ihre Bemerkungen was die Zukunft betrifft Frau Kommissarin</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">but I am not happy about your remarks for the short term </s>    <s id="1:8">aber euh kurzfristig bin ich mit Ihren Bemerkungen mit Ihren Maßnahmen nicht einverstanden</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">I think we do need to do more in the short term to help the industry through this present euh euh crisis</s>    <s id="1:9">kurzfristig muss mehr getan werden um dem Sektor zu helfen die jetzige Krise zu euh durchleben</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">and euh those short-term euh euh measures do require immediate action</s>    <s id="1:10">diese kurzfristigen Maßnahmen erfordern dass wir sofort tätig werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">now I want to make it very clear Commissioner</s>    <s id="1:11">Frau Kommissarin ich möchte jetzt Klartext euh sprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">I remember the time of the milk lakes and the butter mountains</s>    <s id="1:12">ich erinnere mich an die Zeit der Milchseen und der Butterberge</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and I do not want to go back to that</s>    <s id="1:13">dahin möchte ich nicht zurück </s>
#
     <s id="1:14">I don't think anyone in the industry wants to go back to that situation neither the farmer nor the processors nor the Commission nor we in this Parliament</s>    <s id="1:14">niemand im Sektor möchte dahin zurück weder die Erzeuger noch die Verarbeiter noch die Kommission noch wir hier in diesem Parlament</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">we do not want to return to that</s>    <s id="1:15">nein euh diese Zeit soll passé sein</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">but one of the main problems that I see is at the present moment of time while the farmers have taken a drastic reduction in what they are receiving for their milk the consumer is paying almost the same as they paid before that</s>    <s id="1:16">eines euh der Probleme das ich jetzt sehe ist folgendes die euh Erzeuger waren bereit euh einen drastischen Rückgang der Preise zu akzeptieren aber die Verbraucher bezahlen fast genau das gleiche wie vorher</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">and until we tackle the power of the supermarkets in this area we will not have the answer </s>    <s id="1:17">bevor wir nicht hum die Macht euh der Supermarktketten hier in Angriff nehmen  werden wir keine Antwort bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">they have got to be controlled</s>    <s id="1:18">die müssen kontrolliert werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">we need an ombudsperson someone who can tell the supermarkets you are acting beyond your remit you are ripping the people off and you're ripping the farmers off and putting them out of business in the process </s>    <s id="1:19">wir brauchen einen Ombudsmann jemanden der den Supermärkten erklärt euh sie euh überschreiten hier ihren Rahmen sie euh ziehen die Landwirte die Verbraucher ab und das euh stört die Wirtschaft</s>

     <s id="1:2">euh can I say that when farm women start protesting you know there is a serious difficulty</s>    <s id="1:2">darf ich euh zunächst einmal folgendes sagen wenn weibliche Landwirte beginnen zu protestieren dann kann man wissen dass es ein echtes euh Problem euh gibt euh</s>
#
     <s id="1:3">and at the weekend I met a group of Irishwomen called farm women for a fair price</s>    <s id="1:3">es gab nur eine Gruppe von irischen euh Bäuerinnen die sich für faire Preise einsetzen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">and I think we should note the words fair price because producers are not getting a decent or fair price</s>    <s id="1:4">faire Preise das ist das Stichwort weil euh Verbraucher nicht euh einen anständigen Preis bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and that's what this debate is about</s>    <s id="1:5">darum geht es ja in dieser Debatte</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">it would be churlish not to welcome the comments from the Commissioner about a stability coming into the market place although at a very low level</s>    <s id="1:6">es wäre unsinnig euh die Bemerkungen der Kommissarin nicht zu begrüßen wenn sie sagt dass Stabilität auf dem Markt eingerichtet werden soll wenn auch aus der niederen Niveau angesiedelt</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and I acknowledge that the Commission has taken steps and spent money to bring stability to the market place </s>    <s id="1:7">ich erkenne Ansätze der Kommission Schritte ergriffen hat um das zu tun um euh den Markt wieder zu stabilisieren</s>

     <s id="1:8">it's just that it's not enough</s>    <s id="1:8">es reicht aber einfach nicht aus </s>

     <s id="1:11">I want to say that in relation to the future your comments are particularly welcome</s>    <s id="1:11">nun im Hinblick auf die Zukunft  da begrüße ich Ihre Bemerkungen insbesondere</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">I'm worried that this house is divided on the issue of milk quota</s>    <s id="1:12">ich euh mache mir Sorgen dass euh dieses Haus gespalten ist bei der Frage der Milchquoten</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">because when we do have codecision if the Lisbon Treaty comes into force we are going to have to think more coherently as a group and give clear signals to farmers rather than divided messages </s>    <s id="1:13">wenn wir nach dem Vertrag von Lissabon die Mitentscheidung haben dann müssen wir insgesamt kohärenter denken und eine klare Botschaft anstatt als euh gespaltene euh Botschaften an euh die Landwirte zu geben</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">so let me repeat that your comments about making euh links between producers and processors about production levels are something we need to explore and something that we should have to have a further debate on</s>    <s id="1:14">nun noch einmal euh zu der Verbindung von Verbrauchern und euh der verarbeitenden Industrie darüber müssen wir weiter diskutieren das müssen wir weiter sondieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">but we do need to ask you Commissioner what type of market support measures you think will exist in the absence of quota that can ensure a fair and decent price to our producers </s>    <s id="1:15">aber Frau Kommissarin wir müssen die Frage an Sie stellen  was für marktunterstützende Mechanismen stellen Sie sich denn vor wenn es keine Quoten gibt Mechanismen die sicherstellen dass unsere Verbraucher faire anständige Preise bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and please tackle the marketplace</s>    <s id="1:16">und bitte euh euh behandeln sie auch euh die Märkte</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">it is not working</s>    <s id="1:17">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">euh everybody says they're making no money from milk including supermarkets which I doubt euh profusely</s>    <s id="1:18">und alle behaupten dass sie kein Geld machen  sogar die Supermarktketten das zweifele ich an</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">but we need more clarity there</s>    <s id="1:19">wir brauchen da mehr Klarheit</s>

     <s id="1:6">of course I welcome the outcome of the referendum in Ireland</s>    <s id="1:6">also ich begrüße jetzt das Ergebnis des Referendums in Irland</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">along with my Fine Gael colleagues here in the Parliament I worked very hard to achieve that Yes</s>    <s id="1:7">zusammen mit meinen Kollegen im Parlament habe ich euh sehr hart an diesem Ergebnis mitgearbeitet</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">and I would say that the Irish people rose above national problems and other domestic issues and looked at the European question and at the Lisbon Treaty and at the past and our associations with the European Union and overwhelmingly have said Yes to the European Union</s>    <s id="1:8">und die irischen euh Wähler haben euh interne nationale Fragen ad euh links liegen lassen können und haben nur europäische Fragen beurteilt und haben überwältigend Ja zur Union gesagt</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">and that is a fantastic result</s>    <s id="1:9">und das ist ein prima Ergebnis</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">on the other hand Commissioner Wallström who very kindly came to Ireland on a number of occasions will have picked up euh a strong undercurrent which I believe is in all member states of people who are disconnected from what the European Union is about</s>    <s id="1:10">und euh nun freundlicherweise kam mal die Kommissarin offen nach Irland und hat euh diese Strömung auch festgestellt bei Menschen die von der hm EU losgekoppelt sind</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and I think all of us are to blame for that </s>    <s id="1:11">wir alle sind da mitschuldig</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">I believe that we do not speak enough about the project about the European Union about solidarity about what it really means</s>    <s id="1:12">wir reden nicht genug über das europäische Vorhaben über die Union über die Solidarität was das konkret bedeutet</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">we speak more of what we can get or what we give and what's wrong with a directive or what's bad about a regulation</s>    <s id="1:13">also wir reden eher über das was wir kriegen als über das was wir beisteuern wir kritisieren Verordnungen und so weiter</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">so in our politics we perhaps need to rise above some of those issues</s>    <s id="1:14">in unserer Politik sollten wir diese Dinge etwas euh aus der Distanz betrachten </s>
#
     <s id="1:15">because when you're at the referendum stage where we were it involved explaining to people on the streets and in shops and in schools about what Europe is how it works what I do what the Commission does and it's a great exercise</s>    <s id="1:15">und also als es um das Referendum ging mussten wir den Leuten und in Schulen und euh auf der Straße und in den Läden erklären was mache ich was macht die Kommission das ist wirklich 'ne wichtige Sache gewesen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">it really is a very powerful exercise to talk to people directly about the European Union</s>    <s id="1:16">das euh ist ja sehr machtvoll gewesen den Leuten den Menschen direkt von Europa zu erzählen</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">people in Ireland know it better now than they did for the last while because we have engaged so well with them </s>    <s id="1:17">die Iren wissen das jetzt besser als euh in der Vergangenheit weil wir so viel engagiert haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">so I would urge us all here in this House to do more of that at home in our own countries and to avoid knocking the European Union where it's not appropriate criticise by all means where it is</s>    <s id="1:18">und euh mein Aufruf an alle hier im Hause ist macht mehr zu Hause und kritisiert nicht die Union überall wo es nicht angemessen ist nur da Kritik wo sie angemessen ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and for those like Nigel Farage who worry about the Irish being bullied</s>    <s id="1:19">und diejenigen wie Nigel Farage die sich sorgen dass Irland hier geschulregelt wurde</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">we're not easily bullied</s>    <s id="1:20">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">it didn't happen it will never happen</s>    <s id="1:21">das wird nie passieren  das ist nie passiert</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">NONE</s>    <s id="1:22">wird auch nicht weiter passieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">and can I say Commissioner if I'm not here for the end of this debate it's not out of any lack of respect to you or to the President or to the presidency </s>    <s id="1:23">und euh euh das ist jetzt keine Respektlosigkeit Ihnen gegenüber</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">it's other commitments</s>    <s id="1:24">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">but thank you all for your support throughout the last while</s>    <s id="1:25">ich wollte Ihnen sagen  wir danken Ihnen herzlich für alle Unterstützung die wir gekriegt haben</s>

     <s id="1:3">this question euh madam President was submitted by me on behalf of the euh Transport and Tourism Committee of the Parliament as members who had become very concerned over the summer months euh due to the collapse of euh SkyEurope Airline and they approached me to take this initiative on their behalf </s>    <s id="1:3">diese Frage ist meinerseits unterbreitet worden für den Verkehrsausschuss des euh Parlamentes der auch für Tourismus zuständig ist  denn euh über die Sommermonate hinweg euh haben wir uns doch Sorgen gemacht weil euh da die Fluggesellschaft SkyEurope bankrott gegangen ist und euh wir eine Initiative ergriffen haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">madam President it's worth noting that we've had seventy seven airline bankruptcies in the European Union since the year two thousand</s>    <s id="1:4">es hat siebenundsiebzig Bankrotte seit zweitausend gegeben von Fluggesellschaften hier in Europa</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">and sadly in the likely event that some more may follow euh euh during this tough economic climate we believe it is imperative that we use this question tonight to at least open up the debate now about how we can best protect the consumers and air travellers in the European Union</s>    <s id="1:5">und da hm zeichnet sich durchaus noch weiteres ab in diesem eisigen wirtschaftlichen Klima und wir sollten jetzt die Debatte anstoßen wie wir am besten den Verbraucher schützen können sprich den Fluggast in diesem Falle</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">in the case of SkyEurope it was an airline based in Slovakia</s>    <s id="1:6">bei SkyEurope handelte es sich um eine Fluggesellschaft die ihren Geschäftssitz in der Slowakei hatte</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">and we saw passengers being left stranded euh at destinations without accommodation or even a flight home </s>    <s id="1:7">und Passagiere sind euh in ihren Ferienorten hängengeblieben hatten keine Unterkunft mehr und natürlich auch keinen Heimflug</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">we also had the problem that many of these people were told that compensation or even refunds would not be possible as they had not purchased their ticket with a credit card or booked through a travel agent</s>    <s id="1:8">und Entschädigungen oder Erstattungen waren euh für die meisten nicht euh nötig euh möglich weil sie ihr Ticket nicht mit der Kreditkarte gezahlt hatten oder bei einem versicherten Reiseunternehmen gebucht hatten</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">these were passengers madam President who'd booked online through their own accounts</s>    <s id="1:9">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">a practice that has been increasing over many years</s>    <s id="1:10">das ist ein Problem das größer geworden ist in den letzten euh Jahren</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">it isn't an isolated case</s>    <s id="1:11">das ist kein isolierter Fall </s>
#
     <s id="1:12">we saw similar scenes in my home country the United Kingdom last year when Excel airways went bankrupt leaving over two hundred thousand people out of pocket without compensation and stranded througout a whole host of airports throughout Europe</s>    <s id="1:12">denn im Vereinigten Königreich hatten wir letztes Jahr ähnliche Szenen als Excel Airways bankrott ging da sind euh tausende von Passagieren ohne Entschädigung irgendwo an ihren Feriendomizilen gestrandet gewesen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">and it costing them even more money to find accommodation and flights home</s>    <s id="1:13">sie haben ihre Heimflüge selber bezahlen müssen  und mussten auch ihre zusätzlichen Hotelkosten selber bezahlen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">and madam President many of these people aren't regular business flyers or regular flyers like ourselves</s>    <s id="1:14">ich mein all diese Menschen sind euh nun nicht euh die euh Geschäftsreisenden wie wir zum Beispiel</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and they don't have the financial means to deal with this sort of upheaval</s>    <s id="1:15">und sie haben auch gar nicht die finanziellen Möglichkeiten hier etwas zu tun</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">they are normally from those families who spend their savings on a family holiday only to see their hard-earned money go down the drain through little fault of their own</s>    <s id="1:16">das sind meistens Menschen die ihr Erspartes für den Familienurlaub euh ausgeben und dann ist das Geld weg und es ist nicht ihre Schuld</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">the status quo here is clearly not acceptable</s>    <s id="1:17">und dass die Fluggesellschaften euh sagen dass es nicht ihre Schuld ist das ist nicht euh akzeptabel</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and here in the European Union and in the European Parliament we should be proud of our record on passenger rights</s>    <s id="1:18">wir haben ja die Passagierrechte hier immer weiter ausgebaut</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">we've seen the introduction of denied boarding compensation</s>    <s id="1:19">wir haben euh gar zum Beispiel euh die Eincheckkompensierung bekommen</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">although we know there are still issues to resolve with that</s>    <s id="1:20">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">we have seen the introduction of rights to assistance and tougher laws on ticket pricing transparency</s>    <s id="1:21">wir haben das euh Recht auf Hilfeleistung wir haben ein Anrecht auf euh Transparenz in den Ticketpreisen</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">excuse me</s>    <s id="1:22">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">as well as tough compensation measures in the Package Travel Directive</s>    <s id="1:23">wir haben dazu ja euh die Richtlinie </s>
#
     <s id="1:24">in fact I do believe we have covered most of the bases when it comes to consumer protection in aviation </s>    <s id="1:24">und wir haben die meisten euh die meisten Grundlagen abgesichert wenn es um Passagierrechte geht</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">but there is clearly a loophole here that needs to be closed</s>    <s id="1:25">aber hier gibt es eine Lücke die geschlossen werden muss</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">if you book a charter with a holiday company you're covered by the Package Travel Directive</s>    <s id="1:26">wenn man einen Charterurlaub nimmt dann ist man durch die Charter-Richtlinie gedeckt</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">if you book with a scheduled airline you're covered by their system</s>    <s id="1:27">mit einer Fluglinie durch ihr System</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">but if you book online just your seat only airline flight then you aren't covered</s>    <s id="1:28">aber wenn man online bucht nur ein Platz euh auf einer Fluggesellschaft dann ist man nicht erfasst</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">and it's that anomaly and that loophole that the Parliament is seeking the assistance of the Commission to close</s>    <s id="1:29">und diese Lücke euh will das Parlament nun schließen</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">in this question we have also floated the idea of establishing a reserve compensation fund</s>    <s id="1:30">euh wir haben uns auch überlegt ob man nicht einen Reservefonds euh einrichten sollte</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">but this must not be seen as a demand on our part or of the Commission</s>    <s id="1:31">das ist jetzt euh noch nicht alles in trockenen Tüchern</s>
#
     <s id="1:32">we merely wish to open up euh the debate as to what mechanisms might be possible to help us best solve this problem </s>    <s id="1:32">wir wollen erst einmal überhaupt die Debatte anstoßen damit man sich auf Seiten der Kommission überlegen kann wie dieses Problem am besten zu lösen ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:33">so the idea of the question is to start the dialogue with Commission in the hope that we can close this loophole and find a solution to what is a serious problem particularly for those people who find themselves victims of an airline euh insolvency</s>    <s id="1:33">und wir wollen daher den Dialog mit der Kommission aufnehmen damit wir diese Lücke schließen können damit wir eine Lösung finden können für das was ein wirklich ernstes Problem ist  gerade für die Leute die unschuldig Opfer geworden sind von einer euh insolventen Fluggesellschaft</s>
#
     <s id="1:34">and I look forward to working with the Commission to try and find a solution to this problem with my committee and hearing the euh views of the other members</s>    <s id="1:34">wir sollten wirklich versuchen hier eine Lösung zu finden ich und mein Ausschuss wir werden das tun  und ich wäre interessiert an der Meinung der Kollegen</s>

#
     <s id="1:7">and in fact it highlights what an awful muddle the European Union is in euh regarding monitoring and evaluation</s>    <s id="1:7">darin wird sehr deutlich was für eine große Verwirrung da herrscht in der Europäischen Union wenn es um die Evaluierung in diesem Zusammenhang geht</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">it certainly makes no sense to me that fitness to join the Schengen Zone should be exclusively in the hands of the member states in any case irrespective of any arcane split between pre- and post-Schengen accession</s>    <s id="1:8">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">NONE</s>    <s id="1:9">euh die Berechtigung dem Schengener Raum anzugehören sollte in den Mitgliedsstaaten liegen</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">NONE</s>    <s id="1:10">es darf hier keine Spaltung keine Unterschiede zwischen vor und nach Schengen geben beim Beitritt</s>
#
     <s id="1:11">and euh we're told in the Commission proposal for the regulation that as evaluation before putting into effect is fundamental for member states in order to gain mutual trust it seems reasonable for this to remain the responsibility of member states</s>    <s id="1:11">im Kommissionsvorschlag zur Verordnung heißt es dass euh die Evaluierung vorm Inkrafttreten ganz entscheidend ist um gegenseitiges Vertrauen aufzubauen und das musste die Verantwortung der Mitgliedsstaaten bleiben</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">well we don't leave it to member states to evaluate the Balkan countries</s>    <s id="1:12">aber es wird den Mitgliedsstaaten auch nicht überlassen die Balkanstaaten zu euh überprüfen euh euh</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">who this evening in the LIBE Committee we will vote on their fitness for Visa Waiver for visa-free travel</s>    <s id="1:13">da geht es ja dann auch später heute Abend dann noch um Visa-Erleichterungen oder Visa-Befreiungen</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">there it's the Commission which does the assessment and the evaluation</s>    <s id="1:14">das macht doch auch die Kommission und nicht die Mitgliedsstaaten</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">so there's no consistency at all in saying that it should be in the hands of the member states to judge other states</s>    <s id="1:15">also hier gibt es gar keine Konsequenz wenn man sagt das sollte in Händen der Mitgliedsstaaten bleiben  sie sollen das beurteilen</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">and to be honest I actually don't grasp euh this peculiar split between evaluation of putting into effect measures necessary to join Schengen which according to the Commission has to remain intergovernmental and checking the implementation of the euh Schengen acquis</s>    <s id="1:16">und euh ehrlich gesagt verstehe ich euh diese komische Aufspaltung zwischen Evaluierung zur Inkrafttreten hum und zum Beitritt zu Schengen und auf der anderen Seite die Überprüfung hum der Umsetzung des Schengen-Acquis nicht</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">certainly it appears that the member states don't do a very good job because we learn from the proposal for the euh decision that euh in recent years member states have not seen the need to carry out evaluations on the spot concerning judicial cooperation in criminal matters and drugs</s>    <s id="1:17">die Mitgliedsstaaten scheinen hier hum nicht besonders gut zu arbeiten habe ich den Eindruck denn von dem Beschlussentwurf sehen wir ja dass die Mitgliedsstaaten hier in den letzten Jahren euh keine Überprüfung vor Ort euh vorgenommen haben</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">data protection's also not always been subject to on-site evaluations</s>    <s id="1:18">und auch die der Datenschutz euh ist hier nicht euh immer berücksichtigt worden wenn es um diese Evaluierung geht</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">I think there's many people not only in this House but beyond who would think that euh issues to do with criminal cooperation euh drugs euh tackling drug smuggling and protection of privacy are rather important matters to have on-the-spot inspections about</s>    <s id="1:19">also Fragen im Zusammenhang mit euh Zusammenarbeit mit Strafsachen euh Bekämpfung von Drogenhandel Drogenschmuggel und auch Schutz der Privatspähre sind doch da immer wieder euh Angelegenheiten wo es solche Untersuchungen vor Ort geben muss</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">so I entirely support the conclusions of Carlos Coelho euh that euh we need to euh bring all this together to have a consolidation of the procedures by which this evaluation is done to consolidate the task between the first and the third pillar</s>    <s id="1:20">ich bin also auch der Auffassung dass all das zusammengebracht werden muss dass es notwendig ist die Verfahren zu konsolidieren über die diese Evaluierung läuft eine Konsolidierung des ersten und dritten Pfeilers</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">and I hope that soon the phrase third pillar will be consigned to history and I never have to say it again euh and euh to have one simple effective efficient and transparent evaluation and the transparency includes accountability to the European Parliament</s>    <s id="1:21">und ich glaube dass das sowieso bald euh der Vergangenheit angehören wird dann haben wir das Säulen-System nicht mehr es muss eine effiziente und transparente Evaluierung sein damit man hier auch dem Parlament gegenüber Rechenschaftspflicht leisten kann</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">it is euh most strange that at this stage at this juncture on the eve of what I'm now convinced will be the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and I did my bit in the UK House of Lords last year by the way euh that euh the Commission should put forward this extremely muddled and euh senseless euh set of proposals so euh euh I support the rejection</s>    <s id="1:22">ich bin halt davon überzeugt dass es es eine Ratifizierung euh des hum Lissabonner Vertrags geben wird und euh ich hoffe dass die Kommission hier diese euh große Verwirrung dieses Durcheinander an Vorschlägen berichtigen kann ich euh unterstütze das also</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">and I would request the Commission to come back with a better proposal that takes account of the Lisbon Treaty it takes account of codecision it takes account of simplicity and effectiveness in monitoring and is consistent with the Commission's and the Parliament's responsibilities in other areas</s>    <s id="1:23">möchte mich auch dafür aussprechen dass die Kommission einen besseren Vorschlag vorlegt dass sie die Mitentscheidung berücksichtigt den Lissabonner Vertrag und sich dafür einsetzt euh dass das diese Evaluierung effizient euh und transparent geschieht und dann ist das auch im Einklang steht mit der Verantwortung der Mitgliedsstaaten in anderen Bereichen</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">it begs the whole question of the way peer review is done euh euh in this European Union of the twenty seven member states </s>    <s id="1:24">das ist entscheidend in euh dieser Europäischen Union des einundzwanzigsten Jahrhunderts</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">as I say that bears looking at including in the human rights euh area because we don't seem to have any clear principles and euh structures euh and simply adopt different things in different areas</s>    <s id="1:25">schließlich euh geht es da auch dann um Bereiche wie hm Schutz der Menschenrechte denn manchmal fehlt es hier an klaren Grundsätzen  da werden in verschiedenen Bereichen verschiedene Dinge verabschiedet</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">euh much as I love the member states I'm afraid they often adopt practice of I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine which means they don't criticise each other</s>    <s id="1:26">bin ja immer sehr für die Mitgliedsstaaten  aber euh manchmal werden da Maßnahmen verabschiedet die hm eher hum so gestaltet sind dass sie euh sich gegenseitig da nicht auf die Füße treten</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">NONE</s>    <s id="1:27">und das ist nicht immer unbedingt das Beste</s>

     <s id="1:17">NONE</s>    <s id="1:17">da muss auch mal die Frage nach dem Outsourcing dabei stellen</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">euh you mentioned that there have been contractual penalties imposed due to the delays in the Visa Information System</s>    <s id="1:18">dann sagten sie Vertragsstrafen euh seien auferlegt euh worden Konventionalstrafen euh hier beim euh Visa-Informationssystem</s>

     <s id="1:11"> in the two thousand and five UK general election all three main political parties committed themselves in their manifestos to a referendum on the European Constitution as it then was</s>    <s id="1:11">euh bei den Wahlen zweitausendundfünf euh euh haben sich alle drei großen Parteien in ihren Wahlmanifesten verpflichtet zu einem Referendum zur EU-Verfassung euh wie sie damals war</s>

     <s id="1:17">and I want to say particularly to Cecilia Malmström the minister here tonight how impressed the committee was with the work that Sweden is doing euh when we went to visit Sweden on a mission back in September</s>    <s id="1:17">und der Ausschuss war sehr euh beeindruckt von der Rolle Schwedens als wir im September Schweden besuchten</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">and I think that they've clearly set an example to many other people</s>    <s id="1:18">und Schweden hat da wirklich ein Beispiel gesetzt</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">and in particularly the meticulous way in which they are ensuring that public authorities at all levels in Sweden understand their obligations under European law to be able to authorise service companies coming from euh other places within the European Union</s>    <s id="1:19">und ganz besonders die sehr gründliche Art und Weise wie sie dafür gesorgt haben dass die öffentlichen Behörden auf allen Ebenen in Schweden ihre Verpflichtungen nach dem europäischen Gesetz verstehen damit Dienstleistungsunternehmen aus anderen Ländern der Europäischen Union auch tatsächlich dort arbeiten können</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">well now our question tonight euh focuses in particular on what we regard as the most important elements to get in place as soon as possible</s>    <s id="1:20">nun unsere Anfrage heute Nacht konzentriert sich ganz besonders auf die unserer Ansicht nach wichtigsten Elemente dieser Gesetzgebung</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">member states have been required to go through the screening process of their legislation to look as I say for those discriminatory elements </s>    <s id="1:21">die Mitgliedsstaaten sollten also einen Screening-Prozess ihrer Gesetzgebung durchführen um eben die diskriminatorischen Elemente zu beseitigen</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">but the transposition on December the twenty eighth is just the start now of the process of removing obstacles</s>    <s id="1:22">aber die Umsetzung am achtundzwanzigsten Dezember ist ja nur der Beginn eines Prozesses der Beseitigung von Hindernissen</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">because every country is now going to come up with a list of proposals which discriminate against other countries which they believe they can justify in the public interest</s>    <s id="1:23">dann wird es eine Liste geben von Vorschlägen die gegen andere Länder diskriminieren die sie aber im öffentlichen Interesse euh glauben euh vertreten zu können dies ist also eine Liste die von Mitgliedsstaaten aufgestellt wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">and that mutual evaluation process colleagues which is an entirely new one requires other member state authorities to look at each other at each other's discriminatory proposals </s>    <s id="1:24">und das fordert dass die Behörden anderer Mitgliedsstaaten sich einander ansehen und die diskriminatorischen Vorschläge untereinander prüfen</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">that's going to be a vital part that starts</s>    <s id="1:25">da fängt das ja erst so richtig an</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">and we are following that with great interest</s>    <s id="1:26">das verfolgen wir mit großen Interesse</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">we'd like to hear tonight how the Commission is proposing to approach that process</s>    <s id="1:27">und da möchten wir heute gern hören wie die Kommission diesen Prozess durchführen will</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">we'd like to know from Council that support they're giving to that</s>    <s id="1:28">wir möchten von Rat hören welche Unterstützung euh er dem ganzen Prozess gibt</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">and we'd also like an assurance that this is not going to be a process done behind closed doors</s>    <s id="1:29">und wir möchten eine Zusicherung dass dies nicht ein Prozess ist der hinter geschlossenen Türen stattfindet</s>
#
     <s id="1:30">because consumers and businesses and other interest groups will want to know how that process is being carried out </s>    <s id="1:30">denn die Verbraucher Unternehmen und andere Gruppen werden wissen wollen wie dieser Prozess durchgeführt wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:31">we want to see that list</s>    <s id="1:31">wir wollen diese Liste sehen </s>
#
     <s id="1:32">we want to see the list of regulations and euh an internal statutes that member states want to retain</s>    <s id="1:32">wir wollen die Liste von Bestimmungen sehen von  Gesetzesbestimmungen die die Mitgliedsstaaten euh aufrechterhalten wollen</s>

#
     <s id="1:37">it's vital that we have full and complete systems set up</s>    <s id="1:37">und daür brauchen wir ein volles umfassendes System der Information über den Zugang</s>
#
     <s id="1:38">so that's what our question is here tonight </s>    <s id="1:38">das sind also meine Fragen </s>
#
     <s id="1:39">we look forward to misses Ferrero-Waldner perhaps in a field that's not so familiar to her but to give us some comprehensive answers</s>    <s id="1:39">wir wir erhoffen uns euh von Frau Ferrero-Waldner etwas zu hören vielleicht aus einem Bereich der ihr nicht so vertraut ist</s>

     <s id="1:40">we know you'll give our best wishes to Charlie McCreevy from everybody</s>    <s id="1:40">aber sie wird sicherlich auch unsere Meinung Herrn Charlie McCreevy übermittlen können</s>
#
     <s id="1:41">euh I think it's important to understand though the perspective of my committee</s>    <s id="1:41">und ich glaube es ist wichtig zu verstehen welches die Perspektive meines Ausschusses ist</s>
#
     <s id="1:42">for us this is also the start of a process over the next five years of monitoring and sustaining political interest and pressure on all the member states to deliver this directive</s>    <s id="1:42">für uns ist dies auch der Beginn eines Prozesses in den nächsten fünf Jahren ein Prozess der euh Überwachung und der Aufrechterhaltung des politischen Druckes an die Mitgliedsstaaten zur Umsetzung dieser Richtlinie</s>
#
     <s id="1:43">I have to say to Cecilia Malmström it was disappointing euh to say the least to see euh in the report that a competitiveness council discussed back in September a note from the Commission that it would appear in some member states the political commitment to full and timely implementation has unfortunately not been translated into appropriate action</s>    <s id="1:43">und da muss ich Cecilia Malmström sagen es war enttäuschend um es vorsichtig auszudrücken festzustellen euh dass im Bericht des euh Wettbewerbsrates euh eine Bemerkung der Kommission steht dass es anscheinend in einigen Mitgliedsstaaten die hum das politische Engagement euh die hum euh Gesetzgebung umzusetzen sich nicht in der Praxis niedergeschlagen hat</s>
#
     <s id="1:44">colleagues that is not good enough</s>    <s id="1:44">das reicht nicht aus </s>

     <s id="1:45">we want the benefits and we want them now </s>    <s id="1:45">wir wollen diese Umsetzung  und wir wollen sie jetzt</s>

     <s id="1:34">of course in the end a plenary will decide </s>    <s id="1:34">das Plenum wird entscheiden </s>

#
     <s id="1:36">and that is why historically we've had a vice-president chairing that delegation</s>    <s id="1:36">und daher haben wir euh immer einen Vizepräsidenten gehabt</s>
#
     <s id="1:37">in terms of our relationship with the national parliaments we've had some disagreement in the committee about how much detail we should go into how much the rules should prescribe that relationship</s>    <s id="1:37">was die Beziehungen zu den einzelstaatlichen Paralamenten angeht so konnten wir uns im Ausschuss nicht darauf einigen wie detailiert euh unsere Regeln sein sollten zur Beschreibung dieser Beziehungen</s>

#
     <s id="1:50">my view is again absolutely yes</s>    <s id="1:50">meine Meinung ist ja</s>

     <s id="1:51">but the crucial issue and again there's consensus in the committee euh on this but the crucial issue is should these observers be the people who would otherwise have been elected to the European Parliament</s>    <s id="1:51">aber die euh wesentliche Frage ist ob diese Beobachter die Leute sein sollten die auch ansonsten in das Europäische Parlament gewählt worden wären</s>
#
     <s id="1:52">I think that's critical for our credibility</s>    <s id="1:52">ich glaube das ist wichtig für unsere Glaubwürdigkeit</s>

     <s id="1:53"> if we simply allow the member states to appoint anyone to take the role of the observer and we do have rumours that some member states want to appoint national parliamentarians I think that would be entirely unacceptable</s>    <s id="1:53">denn wenn hier irgendeiner benannt wird euh und einige Mitgliedsstaaten euh wollen nationale euh Abgeordnete benennen euh habe ich gehört dann wäre das wirklich nicht akzeptabel</s>
#
     <s id="1:54">President I conclude by saying that I'm pleased that this Parliament by its vote this week will have in place on the first of December from the minute the Lisbon Treaty comes into force a set of rules allowing us to exercise our new powers euh immediately</s>    <s id="1:54">Herr Präsident ich freue mich dass das Parlament diese Woche mit der Abstimmung in dieser Woche am ersten Dezember eine Geschäftsordnung euh haben wird die den neuen Befugnissen des euh Vertrags von Lissabon entsprechen</s>

     <s id="1:4">I think now at the beginning of this Parliament and new Commission it is time we turned our attention to other members of the staffs of the three institutions and that we examined the role of those staffs</s>    <s id="1:4">zu Beginn der neuen Legislaturperiode des Parlamentes und der Kommission müssen wir uns euh auf andere Mitarbeiter in den drei Institutionen konzentrieren und ihre Rolle prüfen</s>

     <s id="1:8">when you got twenty seven member states represented in this Parliament twenty seven Commissioners coming together from those member states into the Commission Council Ministers going back to their parliaments and coming here it is very easy for the staff who elected to serve us to actually take over the agenda</s>    <s id="1:8">siebenundzwanzig Mitlgiedsländer sind hier vertreten  wir haben Kommissare aus siebenundzwanzig Ländern die Ratsminister kommen hierher und gehen wieder zurück in ihre nationalen Parlamente und es ist euh ganz einfach dass dann die Mitarbeiter gewissermaßen die Agenda übernehmen</s>

     <s id="1:10">and what I'm asking is from the very beginning of this Parliament that the incoming Commission euh I don't know what proportion of the budget incidentally is staff but I know it's a substantial part but from the very beginning that the new Commission require a study on what it is the staff of the three institutions do to ensure that they are being efficient and effective and above all that they are transparent and accountable in what it is they do</s>    <s id="1:10">von daher ist es ganz wichtig dass wir bei der nächsten Kommission ich weiß nicht welchen Prozentsatz euh hier in die Mitarbeiter der Kommission gehen aber wir sollten zumindestens mal erfordern dass eine Studie angefertigt wird über die Arbeit die Bewertung der Arbeit der Bediensteten ist die effizient euh machen sie das was sie tun sollen</s>

     <s id="1:6">it was also due to the determination euh of the euh Commission euh to recognise that all of the three institutions needed a cultural change</s>    <s id="1:6">euh sicher auch die Kommission es war doch klar geworden dass alle drei Institutionen eine kulturelle Veränderung brauchten Offenheit und Transparenz</s>

     <s id="1:17">euh we've achieved as I said a huge amount</s>    <s id="1:17">wir haben ja schon sehr viel erreicht </s>

     <s id="1:18">euh we have a register of documents</s>    <s id="1:18">wir haben ein Dokumentenregister</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">euh we have the jurisprudence of euh the ECJ euh now defining and redefining euh what was originally agreed on access to documents</s>    <s id="1:19">wir haben die Rechtsprechung des EuGH es muss neu definiert werden was den Zugang zu Dokumenten ausmacht</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">we've accepted the principle that all documents should remain euh accessible and that where not accessible they should be reasoned euh against euh access should be reasoned against quite clearly and specifically in reference to either euh article four the exemptions or article nine sensitive documents</s>    <s id="1:20">wir haben grundsätzlich ja akzeptiert dass alle Dokumente grundsätzlich zugänglich sein sollten und wo das nicht der Fall ist euh sollte die Beschränkung begründet werden entweder unter Verweis auf Artikel vier die Ausnahmen oder unter Verweis auf Artikel neun sensible Dokumente</s>

     <s id="1:21">but as we've moved on euh euh and the Parliament has called repeatedly for a revision I believe that the revision I  know we have a difference euh of opinion on this that the revision that was placed before euh the Parliament on which we subsequently voted in Committee and deffered our first reading on in March euh of this year that that revision provided by the Commission did not go far enough</s>    <s id="1:21">es haben sich die Dinge weiterentwickelt das Parlament hatte ja mehrfach eine Revision beantragt ich weiß da gibt es Meinungsverschiedenheiten ich weiß aber dass die Revision die dem Parlament vorgelegt wurde dann im Ausschuss euh hum zum Abstimmung kam und wurde in die erste Lesung verschoben wurde im März euh diese Revision von der Kommission ging einfach nicht weit genug</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">and equally there were concerns and those concerns still remain in our House that there was an attempt to claw back on access to documents</s>    <s id="1:22">und es gab da weiterhin Sorgen auch hier im Hause den Zugang zu Dokumenten doch wieder schwieriger zu machen</s>
#
     <s id="1:23">not least euh in the redefining of documents euh the notion that whole files could be exempted and attempting to redefine the notion of the third-party veto</s>    <s id="1:23">über die Neudefinition von Definitionen euh dass euh so auch ganze euh euh Aktengruppen euh unter Ausnahmen fallen könnten und so weiter Drittparteienveto</s>

     <s id="1:24">it's interesting our citizens euh sitting in the gallery must be thinking that we're talking about something that happens in outer space articles euh third-party vetos</s>    <s id="1:24">es ist interessant die Bürger die da oben sitzen haben vielleicht euh den Eindruck dass das Ganze irgendwo im Weltraum geschiet also euh der Artikel Drittparteienveto und so weiter</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">but actually what we're talking about is a law that allows them to make sure that we're accountable parliamentarians accountable for what we do in their name the Commission for what it does in their name and equally the Council </s>    <s id="1:25">nein es geht um ihr Recht das Recht der Bürger euh damit euh wir zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden können die Parlamentarier die Kommission und der Rat die alle in ihrem Namen handeln</s>
#
     <s id="1:26">now how can they do that and the NGOs do that if the way we work and who does what within all of the different units remains euh a well-kept secret euh open only to those lobbyists and those lawyers who know</s>    <s id="1:26">wie kann das gehen wie können die NGOs das bewerkstelligen wenn wir mit unserer Arbeitsweise den unterschiedlichen Abteilungen der Union weiter in Vertraulichkeit oder nach dem Prinzip der Geheimniskrämerei arbeiten</s>
#
     <s id="1:27">and that is what I believe is at the heart of the Treaty of Lisbon it says that we need to further enhance democracy </s>    <s id="1:27">und das ist letztlich am Ende dann doch der Kern des Lissaboner Vertrages dass wir wirklich das ernst nehmen dass die Demokratie verbessert wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:28">we need to enhance access to documents and that is why the Parliament in this oral question is calling for a whole range of recommendations to be undertaken</s>    <s id="1:28">und das bedeutet besseren Zugang zu Dokumenten und deswegen hat das Parlament in dieser mündlichen Anfrage 'ne ganze Reihe von Empfehlungen angemerkt</s>
#
     <s id="1:29">but basically it is about ensuring that the rights that we have are built upon that they are not diminished  and recognising that under Lisbon it's no longer just the three institutions but all of the agencies and the bodies set up by them</s>    <s id="1:29">aber im Wesentlichen geht's darum dass unsere Rechte nicht eingeschränkt werden euh unter Lissabon geht's ja nicht nur um die drei Institutionen sondern auch um alle Agenturen und Gremien die von den Institutionen eingerichtet werden</s>

     <s id="1:23">euh one of the things that our own research has done and this committee commissioned research on this topic it demonstrates the fact that there is nothing like enough coordinated activity on helping people to recognise their rights under mutual recognition</s>    <s id="1:23">und die Kommission hat da auch nachgehakt nachgeforscht  und es zeigt sich dass es da noch längst nicht genug koordinierte Aktivitäten gibt um den euh Bürgern zu helfen hier ihre Rechte wahrnehmen zu können</s>
#
     <s id="1:24">and I think the other aspect euh is that it's also clear from the work that we've done and others that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European Qualification Framework</s>    <s id="1:24">außerdem ist aus unseren Arbeiten ganz klar geworden dass nicht genügend Berufe daran denken sich europäisch zu qualifizieren</s>
#
     <s id="1:25">and I think that there are serious questions that we need to ask about the mechanism </s>    <s id="1:25">da müssen wir doch ganz ernste Fragen stellen</s>

#
     <s id="1:29">it's taken much longer than people expected to bring this into operation and that of itself I think raises concerns about the complexity of the instrument itself</s>    <s id="1:29">das dauert viel länger als man erwartet hat um das alles auf den Weg zu bringen und das führt natürlich zu gewissen Kopfzerbrechen hinsichtlich der Tatsache dass das Instrument wohl zu kompliziert ist</s>

#
     <s id="1:4">and therefore we need to invigorate the debate amongst young women and young men about the equality agenda</s>    <s id="1:4">euh da müssen wir wirklich das Bewusstsein erhöhen auch bei jungen Männern</s>

     <s id="1:5">so that those who are the furthest excluded don't find themselves falling even further behind</s>    <s id="1:5">also das heißt euh wir müssen aufpassen dass denen denen es schon schlecht geht euh die nicht noch weiter zurückfallen</s>

     <s id="1:1">thank you mister President</s>    <s id="1:1">schönen Dank Herr Präsident </s>
#
     <s id="1:2">and may I thank both euh Commissioners</s>    <s id="1:2">ich möchte beiden Kommissaren herzlich danken </s>
#
     <s id="1:3">there are three points I want to raise</s>    <s id="1:3">drei Dinge habe ich anzusprechen</s>
#
     <s id="1:4">one is the euh method and measures to be used for measuring the reconstruction needs of Haiti</s>    <s id="1:4">ad eins Methode und Maßnahmen die eingesetzt werden um den Wiederaufbaubedarf von Haiti messen zu können</s>
#
     <s id="1:5">the other is to ensure that the commitments we are making will be met</s>    <s id="1:5">zweitens wie kann man sicherstellen dass die Zusagen die gemacht werden eingehalten werden</s>
#
     <s id="1:6">and the third is to talk about property rights and the vulnerability of people living in euh shacks for example built on property euh they don't own</s>    <s id="1:6">und Punkt drei wie ist es mit Eigentumsrechten und euh der euh Personen euh die euh jetzt Hütten bauen auf euh Grund und Boden der ihnen nicht gehört</s>
#
     <s id="1:7">let me say first of all in relation to the euh euh reconstruction euh works</s>    <s id="1:7">jetzt mal euh zur Messung euh des euh Wiederaufbaubedarfs</s>
#
     <s id="1:8">I recently attended the World Bank euh euh launch in fact I did the launch euh for the World Bank of a document explaining and suggesting exactly how euh reconstruction should take place in a very well-constructed handbook</s>    <s id="1:8">ich habe bei der Weltbank euh war bei der Weltbank als euh ein Dokument vorgelegt wurde in dem genau steht wie der Wiederaufbau stattfinde sollte  und da euh gibt's so n Handbuch</s>
#
     <s id="1:9">are we going to use this handbook or are we going to use similar measures in ensuring that the  reconstruction effort in Haiti is professionally attended to</s>    <s id="1:9">werden wir dieses Handbuch nutzen oder gibt es ähnliche Maßnahmen um sicherzustellen dass der Wiederaufbau in euh Haiti wirklich professionell gemacht wird</s>
#
     <s id="1:10">the World Bank have done excellent work on this</s>    <s id="1:10">die Weltbank hat da hervorragende Arbeit geleistet </s>
#
     <s id="1:11">the report is there</s>    <s id="1:11">der euh Bericht existiert</s>
#
     <s id="1:12">the Haitian ambassador attended when I launched that particular book</s>    <s id="1:12">und euh der haitianische Botschaft war auch zugegen</s>
#
     <s id="1:13">secondly in relation to commitments we're making I'm very glad to hear what the Commissioner had to say about the two hundred million euh which he is euh euh forwarding almost immediately</s>    <s id="1:13">zweiter Punkt  es sind ja Zusagen gemacht worden finanzieller Art  zweihundert Millionen die werden sofort freigesetzt</s>
#
     <s id="1:14">will we be back here in a year or will we be back here in five years or are we at last going to actually deliver on donor commitments to a country a poor country that simply cannot be left on its knees any longer</s>    <s id="1:14">aber in einem Jahr euh oder in fünf Jahren werden wir hier wieder stellen werden wir denn unsere Geberzusagen dann auch bedient haben einem armen Land gegenüber das können wir nicht allein lassen</s>
#
     <s id="1:15">and the third point I want to make is this</s>    <s id="1:15">dann dritte Bemerkung</s>
#
     <s id="1:16">the extent of the destruction in Haiti was such euh that euh we really have to look at not just the damage done but why that damage was so extensive</s>    <s id="1:16">die Zerstörung in Haiti war derartig groß dass wir uns wirklich euh verschiedene Sachen ansehen müssen nicht nur euh den Schaden an sich sondern weshalb so n großer Schaden euh geschehen ist euh</s>
#
     <s id="1:17">people who did not own property were living in ravines euh and on the sides of mountains and in shacks and in any thing they could put together</s>    <s id="1:17">NONE</s>
#
     <s id="1:18">NONE</s>    <s id="1:18">wir müssen uns euh die euh Geografie ansehen</s>
#
     <s id="1:19">because they didn't own the property on which they were living</s>    <s id="1:19">oft wird gebaut auf Grund und Boden euh der einem nicht gehört</s>
#
     <s id="1:20">if people have property rights they will invest in building in constructing properties that have some chance to resist euh future euh euh damage of this kind</s>    <s id="1:20">und wenn man den Menschen Eigentumsrechte einräumen würde dann würden sie sicherlich auch n bisschen stabiler bauen um zukünftigen Schaden vorzubeugen</s>
#
     <s id="1:21">so I ask that that be given active consideration as part of the approach to dealing with this problem</s>    <s id="1:21">also das denke ich ist wichtig auch ein Teil euh unser Wiederaufbauhilfe</s>
#
     <s id="1:22">and again mister President then I thank both Commissioners for their presentation </s>    <s id="1:22">vielen herzlichen Dank nochmal an die Kommissionsvertreter</s>
